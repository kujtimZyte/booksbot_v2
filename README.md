# scraper

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dust10141/scraper/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dust10141/scraper/tree/master)

A spider for crawling news sites.

## Raison D'Ãªtre :thought_balloon:
This program was made to solve the problem of crawling an array of popular news sites, extracting the relevant information and dumping it to a GCS bucket.

## Architecture :triangular_ruler:
`scraper` aims to have thorough testing for all the sites it supports. It contains various layers that are responsible for choosing the correct parser for the content.
The layer design is as follows:
- **The Main Parser**, which takes a response, and forwards it to the appropriate domain parser.
- **The Domain Parser**, which takes a response for a particular, and forwards it to the appropriate version parser.
- **The Version Parser**, parses a response for a particular version of a domain.

The support table looks like so:

| News Site                                                           | Last Updated      | Status |

## Usage example :eyes:
Once this system is running it will post JSON files to the GCS bucket defined. The standard format will look like so:
```json

    "items":[
        {
            "url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/23/jamal-khashoggi-trump-cover-up-sanctions-visas",
