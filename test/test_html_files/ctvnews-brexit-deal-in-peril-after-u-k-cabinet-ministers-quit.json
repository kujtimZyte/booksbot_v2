We can risk no Brexit at all. Or we can choose to unite and\nsupport the best deal that can be negotiated -- this deal.\"\n\nBut the resignations, less than a day after the Cabinet collectively backed\nthe [draft divorce agreement](http://www.gov.uk/government/publications\n/progress-on-the-uks-exit-from-and-future-relationship-with-the-european-\nunion), weakened May and emboldened her rivals within her Conservative Party.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, a leader of the party's pro-Brexit wing, threatened to\ntrigger a leadership challenge. He asked rhetorically in Parliament, \"should I\nnot write\" to Graham Brady, who heads a committee governing Conservative\nleadership contests.\n\nUnder Conservative rules, a confidence vote in the leader is triggered if 15\nper cent of Conservative lawmakers -- currently 48 -- write a letter to Brady,\nhead of the party's so-called 1922 Committee of backbenchers.\n\nRaab said in his resignation letter that \"I cannot in good conscience support\nthe terms proposed for our deal with the EU.\"\n\n\"I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made.\"\n\nRaab is the second Brexit Secretary that May has lost -- David Davis, who like\nRaab backed Brexit in the U.K.'s June 2016 referendum on its membership of the\nEU, quit in July of this year.\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey followed Raab out the door. She said\nin a letter that it is \"no good trying to pretend to (voters) that this deal\nhonours the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone that it\ndoesn't.\"\n\nThe departures -- several junior ministers have also quit -- are a further\nsign that many supporters of Brexit won't back May in a vote in Parliament on\nthe deal. That prompted a big fall in the value of the pound, which was\ntrading 1.3 per cent lower at $1.2829.\n\nPro-Brexit politicians say the agreement, which calls for close trade ties\nbetween the U.K. and the bloc, would leave Britain a vassal state, bound to EU\nrules that it has no say in making.\n\nBefore Parliament votes on the deal -- the culmination of a year and a half of\nnegotiations between the two sides -- EU leaders have to give their backing.\nOn Thursday, EU chief Donald Tusk called for a summit of leaders to take place\non Nov. 25 so they can rubber-stamp the draft deal reached by officials\nearlier this week.\n\nMay has supporters in her party, and they argued Thursday that the\nalternatives -- leaving the trading bloc without a deal or a second vote on\nBrexit -- were not realistic options.\n\n\"'No deal' is not pretty,\" Health SecretaryMatt Hancock told BBC Radio 4. \"A\nsecond referendum would be divisive but not be decisive.\"\n\nBut May's chances of getting her deal through Parliament before the U.K.\nleaves the bloc on March 29 appeared to be shrinking. Her Conservative\ngovernment doesn't have enough lawmakers of its own to get a majority, and\nrelies on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland,\nwhich says it will not back the deal.\n\nThe DUP leader in Parliament, Nigel Dodds, said the \"choice is now clear: we\nstand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the\nintegrity of the United Kingdom, or we vote for a vassal state with the\nbreakup of the United Kingdom, that is the choice.\"\n\nOpposition parties also signalled that they would vote against the agreement\nif it comes before them -- most likely in December.\n\nMain opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said May should withdraw the\n\"half-baked\" Brexit deal. He said Parliament \"cannot and will not accept a\nfalse choice between this deal and no deal.\"\n\nIan Blackford, who heads the Scottish National Party in Parliament, said the\ndeal was \"dead on arrival\" and urged May to stop the countdown clock to\nBritain's exit, less than five months away.\n\n\"Do the right thing and we will work with you,\" he said. \"Stop the clock and\ngo back to Brussels.\"\n\nMeanwhile in Brussels, Tusk heaped praise on the EU's Brexit negotiator,\nMichel Barnier, who had \"achieved the two most important objectives\" for the\nbloc -- limiting the damage caused by Britain's impending departure and\nmaintaining the interests of the other 27 countries that will remain in the EU\nafter Brexit.\n\n\"As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this\nfarewell the least painful possible for both for you and for us,\" said Tusk,\nwho in his role as European Council President chairs the meetings of leaders.\n\nThe deal requires the consent of the European Parliament as well as the\nBritish one.
