It was the biggest part of my life as a teenager, one of my priorities as a college student, and eventually one of my most expensive \u201chobbies\u201d as a young professional. \n\n[](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2018/)\n\n### Further Reading\n\n[Ars Technica\u2019s best games of 2018](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2018/)\n\nThen all of a sudden, after thousands of hours spent playing across genres and platforms, boredom hit me hard for the very first time in my early thirties.

Collecting information from a staggering 239,000 gamers in recent years, market research company Quantic Foundry has been closely examining how gaming motivations and preferences change with age via its [Gamer Motivation Profile](https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/surveys/start/gamerprofile/).\n\nThe research suggests that many things occur as we age, all pushing people a bit further away from gaming. It\u2019s not that we wake up one morning thinking video games are boring all of sudden, but instead everything happens slowly throughout a lengthy process that most of us don\u2019t even realize.

There is a general lack of reward when it comes to gaming\u2014at least in terms of how adults interpret the concept of reward. The repetition of an activity that doesn\u2019t produce a visible benefit can decrease the feeling of novelty, and that\u2019s when boredom may strike. Breaking virtual records and topping the scoreboards may be bigger goals for a teenager, but for a young professional in their early thirties, something with a concrete output\u2014think cooking, painting, gardening, or bodybuilding\u2014may appear to be much more rewarding. Studies (like another [good one from Florida State researchers in 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5637547/)) back this up, showing that certain adults simply don\u2019t view gaming as a productive activity on which to spend their free time.
