She was\nunsure about getting credit or a traditional bank loan, as two of her business\ncredit cards were cancelled out of the blue, one due to a bank closure. In the\nabsence of other good options, Moody decided to lease the printers and found\nshe got lower payments and more buyer protection than she would have expected\nwith traditional bank financing.  \n  \n\"I particularly liked the lease experience because we had a problem with one\nof the printers, and if we had purchased the printer outright, we probably\nwouldn't have been able to return the printer as easily,\" Moody says. \"Since\nthe leasing company withheld payment until we were satisfied with the product,\nwe were able to get the seller's attention and return [the printer] after\nseveral different software trials failed. The lease was much easier to obtain\nthan a traditional loan, and they guaranteed the equipment.\"  \n  \nWhile bank financing remains elusive for many small businesses, lease\nfinancing is a viable, but little understood, alternative. \"So many business\nowners think they have to go to a local bank [to get a loan], and they're\nsurprised to find there are all these leasing companies out there, financing\n$500 billion-plus in business equipment each year,\" says Ralph Petta, interim\npresident of the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association.  \n  \nIn fact, small businesses use computers, trucks, furniture, factory machinery,\nairplanes and other types of equipment that were purchased through lease\nfinancing. For many of these companies, leasing is not just an alternative to\na bank loan or credit card debt; it's a deliberate financing strategy.  \n  \n\"Businesses that can retain or expand their cash and bank lines have the best\nchance of surviving in this business climate,\" says Joel Ronan of Atlantic\nBusiness Credit a lease financing firm in Stuart, Fla. \"Any credit lines you\ncan establish or expand--be it with vendors, banks or equipment lessors--will\nallow you more breathing room.\" Ronan adds that there are many businesses that\nare failing because of cash flow problems. Some of those businesses may even\nbe profitable, but their cash is tied up in inventory or receivables.\nEquipment is an alternative line of credit that allows for greater liquidity.  \n **  \nBank Loan Reject? No Problem**  \nMoody says her equipment lease was much easier to obtain than a bank loan, and\nleasing industry professionals say that's no accident. Banks and leasing\nfinance companies are set up differently and are often looking at different\ncriteria when it comes to loaning money. \"Generally, equipment finance\nspecialty companies will give greater consideration to the collateral value of\nthe equipment than a bank because they have more specific experience with the\nequipment and may be better equipped to recover a loss if their customer\ndefaults,\" says Robert Boyer, president of Susquehanna Commercial Finance,\nInc., and chairman of ELFA's Small Business Steering Committee. \"There are\nsome advantages a lessor has on a lease that a lender does not have with a\nloan in the event of a bankruptcy, so there may be structures that an\nequipment finance company can use to get a higher level of comfort on a\ntransaction.\"\n\nIn other words, even if your company has been turned down for a bank loan,\nthat doesn't mean you won't be approved for lease financing. \"Particularly for\nequipment leases under $15,000, transactions flow freely, even for startups or\n[companies with] credit scores in the low 600s,\" Ronan says. \"Leasing can\nserve as a reasonable alternative for bank declines.\"\n\nIn fact, some banks have equipment finance divisions or subsidiaries that\noffer leasing services to their clients, Boyer says. And currently, as federal\nregulators have tightened their position on how much commercial real estate\nlending banks can carry, \"they want banks to increase their percentage of\ncommercial and industrial lending,\" says Erik Dickinson, vice president of\nequipment finance and leasing at Red Mountain Bank in Birmingham, Ala. \"This\nwould be lines of credit and equipment financing.\"  \n  \n**Beyond Paying Rent**  \nUnlike leasing an apartment, some business leases are more like loans, so the\nbusiness actually owns the equipment and can receive tax benefits through its\ndepreciation. (A new legislative proposal under consideration by Congress\nwould allow companies to expense these assets and write them off more quickly\nthan is currently allowed.)  \n  \nBut in some cases, a true lease, in which a business pays rent on the\nequipment until the life of the lease expires, can make more sense than\npurchasing. At Women's Health Specialists in Jensen Beach, Fla., administrator\nBill Hughes, CPA, prefers to lease equipment that becomes outdated quickly,\nsuch as diagnostic equipment and personal computers.  \n  \n\"Advances in technology usually make the equipment obsolete by the end of the\nfinancing term,\" Hughes says. \"Not owning the obsolete equipment at the end of\nfinancing does not put you in the bind of having to store or dispose of the\nold equipment.\"  \n  \n **Benefits to Enjoy**  \nFor companies in a cash-flow crunch, the most valuable advantage to leasing is\nthe ability to hold onto their cash. In most cases, a company can get the\nequipment it needs with little or no down payment, allowing it to preserve\nworking capital and lines of credit for other uses, Dickinson says.  \n  \nAnd unlike the lengthy approval process for most loans, lease transactions can\nhappen fast; many lease transactions under a certain threshold can be approved\nwithin 24 hours. \"Most equipment finance companies will review credit based on\na simple, one-page application if the transaction is less than $50,000,\" Boyer\nsays. \"There are many companies that have higher thresholds, maybe even as\nhigh as $250,000 for certain industries. Anything over this application-only\nthreshold will generally require the applicant to submit tax returns or\naccountant-prepared financial statements.\"  \n  \nEven those transactions that require a complete credit package are often\nprocessed within 10 days, Ronan says. \"Of course the rates are higher, but\nmany times the lease payment is not material when you consider the income the\nnew leased equipment generates or efficiencies it creates in the business,\" he\nsays.  \n  \nFinally, leasing can offer tax benefits. For Women's Health Specialists, the\nability to immediately include the total payment as a business expense, rather\nthan writing off only the interest and eventual depreciation of the equipment,\nis one of the most important reasons to lease, according to Hughes. For\ninstance, \"Car leases allow you to write off the entire payment versus\ninterest expense and depreciation,\" he says.  \n  \n **Pitfalls to Avoid**  \nWhile scores of business owners successfully lease equipment and enjoy the\naccompanying tax and cash-flow benefits, many others have had negative leasing\nexperiences. For instance, the credit card machine industry is notorious for\nproblematic leases, Ronan says. \"In many cases, a low-cost item, say $500, is\nleased on a continuous basis at something like $35 per month,\" he says.\n\"Historically, these leases go on for years with tremendous yields to the\nlessor. Resentments grow when the lessee understands years later he has paid\nfor the thing several times over. Beware of any company that will not sell but\nonly leases. You are probably going for a long ride.\"  \n  \nTo avoid similar problems, keep these tips in mind:\n\n  * If you're unfamiliar with the finance company, conduct a background check. Boyer recommends using Dun  & Bradstreet reports or the Better Business Bureau. \n  * Before signing anything, find out what happens at the end of the original lease term. For instance, you may have an option to purchase the equipment at a deep discount. Whatever the terms are, make sure they are explicitly determined and in writing. \n  * Find out the fees associated with the lease transaction,\" Ronan says. Some common fees include documentation fees and late fees. \"Many quotes with low rates are rich with fees,\" he says. \n  * If a down payment or deposit is required with your application, \"make sure there are specific terms that spell out the offering being made and what will happen to the down payment if the company is unable to approve the transaction,\" Boyer says. \n\n",
