The egg and\nbeef operation, 45 minutes outside Canberra, is experiencing its driest seven\nmonths on record, with less than 150mm of rainfall.\n\nBut, unlike other farms in the region, there's water flowing through the creek\n\u2014 crystal clear water, good enough to drink.\n\nThis is no miracle \u2014 it's the result of Mr Coote's dedication over a decade to\nthe ethos of Peter Andrews, lauded for his ability to rehabilitate dry,\ndegraded and salt-ravaged landscapes.\n\n![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10382672-3x2-700x467.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10382672-3x2-940x627.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10382672-16x9-2150x1210.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10334576-3x2-700x467.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10334576-3x2-940x627.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10334576-16x9-2150x1210.jpg)\n\nAustralian Story's 2005 episode on Mr Andrews and Tarwyn Park, the Hunter\nValley property where he pioneered his controversial land regenerating system\nknown as Natural Sequence Farming, was one of the program's most popular ever.\n\n[Ten years later, Tarwyn Park was acquired by Korean mining\ninterests](/news/2015-05-11/hopes-tarwyn-park-natural-sequence-farming-\nmethods-to-continue/6459040), but that didn't stop Mr Andrews's groundbreaking\nwork.\n\nHe travels the country advising landholders, and Mr Coote ensured ongoing\nscientific research and lobbying for Natural Sequence Farming through his\nlegacy, The Mulloon Institute.\n\nAnd Mr Andrews's son, Stuart, runs the Tarwyn Park Training Program at the\ninstitute.\n\n\"The elixir of life; can't get water that tastes like that out of a city\nanywhere,\" says Mr Andrews, 78, as he negotiates the rocky edge of Mulloon\nCreek to reach down and cup some water in his hand.\n\nIn the midst of the state's worst drought in decades, with no reprieve\nforecast, it truly is a sight to behold.\n\n[**Video:** Peter Andrews (right), pictured with his son Stuart, pioneered\nNatural Sequence Farming.

We know our bodies cannot work unless\nthey're hydrated, we know plants and animals can't work unless they are\nhydrated. But our land is dehydrated,\" Mr Coote [told Australian Story in\n2015](/news/2015-05-05/the-battle-for-tarwyn-park/6441486).\n\n> We can fix all this, that's the good news. And we can do it\u00a0quickly.\n\n[ ![Tony Coote and Peter Andrews ,pictured here in\n2006.](/news/image/10382926-3x2-940x627.jpg) ](/news/2018-10-29/tony-coote-\nand-peter-andrews/10382994)[**Photo:** Tony Coote and Peter Andrews (pictured\nhere in 2006) developed a friendship through their shared love of the land.\n(Supplied: The Mulloon Institute) ](/news/2018-10-29/tony-coote-and-peter-\nandrews/10382994)\n\nAt Mulloon Creek, the two men set to work building Mr Andrews's signature\n\"leaky weirs\" in the creek, one of many crucial steps in a complex plan to\nrestore the landscape's original processes.\n\nUsing rocks, fallen trees and other natural debris, a weir is constructed\nacross the creek, not to stop the water from flowing through, but to slow the\nwater down.\n\nIt then has a chance to seep into the landscape on either side, rather than\ngushing down the creek system and straight out to sea, taking important\nnutrients with it.\n\nThis is why Mulloon Creek is still running, even though there has been little\nrain. That water, which was stored in the landscape, is now seeping back into\nthe creek.\n\n\"All we've done is reproduced what was a natural process in Australia's\nlandscapes,\" Mr Andrews says.\n\n\"We've been able to get water into the floodplains which sustains the\nlandscape in a drought.\"\n\nThe change to the landscape on Mr Coote's farm is striking.\n\n\"It was so degraded that we put six truckloads of blackberry canes in the\ncreek to trigger the fertility. Now it's growing its own fertility. It's got\nto the stage now where fish would love to live there, every bird wants to go\nthere and the frogs are all singing. They're happy,\" Mr Andrews says.\n\n![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330088-3x2-700x467.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330088-3x2-940x627.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330088-16x9-2150x1210.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330090-3x2-700x467.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330090-3x2-940x627.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330090-16x9-2150x1210.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330094-3x2-700x467.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330094-3x2-940x627.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330094-16x9-2150x1210.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330098-3x2-700x467.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330098-3x2-940x627.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330098-16x9-2150x1210.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330084-3x2-700x467.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330084-3x2-940x627.jpg)![](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10330084-16x9-2150x1210.jpg)\n\n[ ![A before and after composite of an almost empty creek and a full creek\nincluding reeds.](/news/image/10370752-3x2-940x627.jpg) ](/news/2018-10-29\n/before-and-after-mulloon-institute/10370802)[**Photo:** 2006 vs 2013:\nEvidence of landscape rejuvenation at the Mulloon Creek Natural Farms at\nBungendore.

For more than a decade, two farmers have shown that parched\nlandscapes can be revived. And finally Canberra's listening.\nBy Winsome Denyer\nUpdated about an hour agoSun 28 Oct 2018, 11:15pm\n  Photo: Before and After: Mulloon Creek\nin 1977 and 2015.  (Supplied: The Mulloon Institute) \nWhen Tony Coote was buried in August on his beloved property, Mulloon Creek\nNatural Farms, his mischievous sense of humour was evident: he was lowered\ninto his grave in a handmade wicker basket made of willow.\nIt was, some say, a parting gesture to those who had complained about him\nplanting willow trees to repair degraded landscapes.\nLike the rest of New South Wales, Mulloon Creek is in drought. The egg and\nbeef operation, 45 minutes outside Canberra, is experiencing its driest seven\nmonths on record, with less than 150mm of rainfall.\nBut, unlike other farms in the region, there's water flowing through the creek\n\u2014 crystal clear water, good enough to drink.\nThis is no miracle \u2014 it's the result of Mr Coote's dedication over a decade to\nthe ethos of Peter Andrews, lauded for his ability to rehabilitate dry,\ndegraded and salt-ravaged landscapes.\n\n\nAustralian Story's 2005 episode on Mr Andrews and Tarwyn Park, the Hunter\nValley property where he pioneered his controversial land regenerating system\nknown as Natural Sequence Farming, was one of the program's most popular ever.\nTen years later, Tarwyn Park was acquired by Korean mining\ninterests, but that didn't stop Mr Andrews's groundbreaking\nwork.\nHe travels the country advising landholders, and Mr Coote ensured ongoing\nscientific research and lobbying for Natural Sequence Farming through his\nlegacy, The Mulloon Institute.\nAnd Mr Andrews's son, Stuart, runs the Tarwyn Park Training Program at the\ninstitute.\n\"The elixir of life; can't get water that tastes like that out of a city\nanywhere,\" says Mr Andrews, 78, as he negotiates the rocky edge of Mulloon\nCreek to reach down and cup some water in his hand.\nIn the midst of the state's worst drought in decades, with no reprieve\nforecast, it truly is a sight to behold.\nVideo: Peter Andrews (right), pictured with his son Stuart, pioneered\nNatural Sequence Farming.  (ABC News) \n'Leaky weirs' to slow water\nWhen Mr Coote, the then-executive chairman of Angus and Coote Jewellers,\nwatched Mr Andrews's Australian Story, he was riveted.\nMr Coote could see the genius behind his method of reading the landscape and\ntapping into the land's natural system of self-rehydration.\nHe reached out to Mr Andrews and asked him to take a look at the Mulloon Creek\nproperty he'd bought in the late 1960s.\n\"Our land is severely dehydrated. We know our bodies cannot work unless\nthey're hydrated, we know plants and animals can't work unless they are\nhydrated. But our land is dehydrated,\" Mr Coote told Australian Story in\n2015.\n\nWe can fix all this, that's the good news. And we can do it\u00a0quickly.\n\n  Photo: Tony Coote and Peter Andrews (pictured\nhere in 2006) developed a friendship through their shared love of the land.\n(Supplied: The Mulloon Institute) \nAt Mulloon Creek, the two men set to work building Mr Andrews's signature\n\"leaky weirs\" in the creek, one of many crucial steps in a complex plan to\nrestore the landscape's original processes.\nUsing rocks, fallen trees and other natural debris, a weir is constructed\nacross the creek, not to stop the water from flowing through, but to slow the\nwater down.\nIt then has a chance to seep into the landscape on either side, rather than\ngushing down the creek system and straight out to sea, taking important\nnutrients with it.\nThis is why Mulloon Creek is still running, even though there has been little\nrain. That water, which was stored in the landscape, is now seeping back into\nthe creek.\n\"All we've done is reproduced what was a natural process in Australia's\nlandscapes,\" Mr Andrews says.\n\"We've been able to get water into the floodplains which sustains the\nlandscape in a drought.\"\nThe change to the landscape on Mr Coote's farm is striking.\n\"It was so degraded that we put six truckloads of blackberry canes in the\ncreek to trigger the fertility. Now it's growing its own fertility. It's got\nto the stage now where fish would love to live there, every bird wants to go\nthere and the frogs are all singing. They're happy,\" Mr Andrews says.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Photo: 2006 vs 2013:\nEvidence of landscape rejuvenation at the Mulloon Creek Natural Farms at\nBungendore.  (Supplied: The Mulloon Institute) \nThriving during drought\n\nFarmers across the eastern seaboard are suffering through a drought that some\nconsider the worst in living memory.\nAnd, after a long winter, the Mulloon Creek Natural Farms' paddocks don't look\nvery green. But when you look closely, you can see life just below the blanket\nof brown; shoots of green grass poke up to the surface, thanks to the moisture\nin the soil.\n\"The soil is alive,\" says The Mulloon Institute's Peter Hazell.\n\"It's alive with fungus and bacteria, earthworms, and they're all processing\nthat organic matter and that litter.
