Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean described the incident at the Borderline Bar and Grill as a \"tragic, tragic situation.\"\n\n## ['I'm scared:' Eyewitness describes seeing shooter inside Borderline Bar](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/eyewitness-inside-borderline-bar-at-thousand-oaks-calif-1364962883812)\n\nNov. 8, 201801:49\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/eyewitness-inside-borderline-bar-at-thousand-oaks-calif-1364962883812)[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text='I'm scared:' Eyewitness describes seeing shooter inside Borderline Bar&via=nbcnews&url=https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/eyewitness-inside-borderline-bar-at-thousand-oaks-calif-1364962883812&original_referer=https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/eyewitness-inside-borderline-bar-at-thousand-oaks-calif-1364962883812)[](mailto:?subject=Eyewitness inside Borderline Bar at Thousand Oaks, Calif.&body=https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/eyewitness-inside-borderline-bar-at-thousand-oaks-calif-1364962883812)\n\nAuthorities confirmed that the shooter had been killed and Dean said it was too early to determine whether there was any link to terrorism.\n\nLaw enforcement officials say they have a tentative identification, but they're not yet revealing the name. The gunman is a 29-year-old white male, who is heavily tattooed, several sources said.\n\nDean said on \"Today\" that that investigators were seeking to identify him using fingerprints and tattoos.\n\nThe identification process has been slower than normal, because the gunman, armed with a single handgun, was apparently not carrying a driver's license or any other form of ID.\n\nPresident Donald Trump [sent two tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1060515116700045312) paying tributes to the authorities and victims. He praised the \"great bravery shown by police\" and said \"God bless all of the victims and families of the victims.\"\n\nThe police officer killed was named as Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year police veteran with a wife and son who was looking to retire in the next year.\n\n\"He was hard-working, he was totally committed, he gave his all and, tonight, as I told his wife, he died a hero,\" an emotional Dean said. \"He gave his life to save other people.\"\n\n\nHelus, 54, arrived at the scene alongside a colleague from the California Highway Patrol within three minutes of reports of shots being fired at around 11:20 p.m. (2:20 a.m. ET Thursday), according to Dean.\n\nAfter hearing more gunfire, Helus and the Highway Patrol officer entered the building and Helus \"was struck multiple times with gunfire,\" according to Dean.\n\n## [Sergeant killed in Thousand Oaks shooting was 'hero,' sheriff says](https://www.today.com/video/sergeant-killed-in-thousand-oaks-shooting-was-hero-sheriff-says-1365023811908)\n\nNov. 8, 201804:55\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.today.com/video/sergeant-killed-in-thousand-oaks-shooting-was-hero-sheriff-says-1365023811908)[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Sergeant killed in Thousand Oaks shooting was 'hero,' sheriff says&via=nbcnews&url=https://www.today.com/video/sergeant-killed-in-thousand-oaks-shooting-was-hero-sheriff-says-1365023811908&original_referer=https://www.today.com/video/sergeant-killed-in-thousand-oaks-shooting-was-hero-sheriff-says-1365023811908)[](mailto:?subject=Sergeant killed in Thousand Oaks shooting was \u2018hero,\u2019 sheriff says&body=https://www.today.com/video/sergeant-killed-in-thousand-oaks-shooting-was-hero-sheriff-says-1365023811908)\n\nThe other officer went back into the building and dragged Helus out of the line of fire, but he died in the hospital hours later, the sheriff said.\n\nA SWAT team, FBI and others officers arrived soon after.

Other witnesses described people using bar stools to break windows and escape. \"It's a horrific scene in there, there's blood everywhere.\"\n\nA single shooter was also found killed by a gunshot wound, Dean said, adding that it was unclear exactly who had killed the suspect. \"We don't know who shot anybody at this point,\" he said.\n\n![People comfort each other near the scene of Wednesday's mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California.](https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_45/2638381/181108-thousand-oaks-shooting-mc-1037_8198b6342cd368530a8d82d99f18471e.fit-760w.JPG)People comfort each other near the scene of Wednesday's mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California.Mark J.
