In <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-orders-white-house-returns-press-pass-to-cnns-jim-acosta\">ruling</a> that the administration temporarily has to restore Acosta&apos;s White House access pass on Fifth Amendment due process grounds, federal judge&#xA0;Timothy J.

(Kelly, in his preliminary decision, did not rule on CNN&apos;s First Amendment claim.)\n\nBut Trump, speaking to Wallace, floated another idea for handling Acosta, who frequently spars with the president at length during press conferences.\n\n&quot;I think one of the things we&#x2019;ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don&#x2019;t have any air time, although I&#x2019;ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows,&quot; Trump mused.&#xA0;&quot;I mean, with this stuff you never know what&#x2019;s going to happen.&quot;\n\nCalling Acosta &quot;unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who&#x2019;s a wonderful woman,&quot; Trump said his administration is currently formulating &quot;rules and regulations&quot; for White House reporters. &quot;And if he misbehaves, we&#x2019;ll throw him out or we&#x2019;ll stop the news conference,&quot; the president added.\n\n![As President Donald Trump points to CNN's Jim Acosta, a White House aide takes the microphone from him during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, in Washington.

Rick Scott won Florida.&quot;\n\nThe results of a manual recount in the Florida Senate were reported on Sunday, and Scott prevailed over Democratic incumbent Sen.

[bin Laden] lived in Pakistan, we&#x2019;re supporting Pakistan, we&#x2019;re giving them $1.3 billion a year -- which we don&#x2019;t give them anymore, by the way.&#xA0;I ended it because they don&#x2019;t do anything for us, they don&#x2019;t do a damn thing for us.&quot;\n\nTrump also characterized Adm. William H. McRaven, who oversaw the operation to kill bin Laden, as a &quot;Hillary Clinton fan&quot; when Wallace mentioned that he has criticized Trump&apos;s harsh rhetoric on the media as a major threat to democracy. McRaven was on Clinton&apos;s shortlist for vice president in 2016 and has praised her publicly.\n\n&quot;Wouldn&apos;t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn&#x2019;t it have been nice?&#x201D; Trump asked Wallace, seemingly attacking either McRaven or Pakistani officials.\n\nAnd Trump sounded a note of regret for not visiting Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C., on Veterans Day -- which Obama did several times when&#xA0;he was in office.\n\n&quot;I should have done that,&quot; Trump said.&#xA0;&quot;I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling, as you know. ...&#xA0;&#xA0;I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year.&#xA0; But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American cemetery in Paris and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/emergency-protest-against-jeff-sessions-firing-threads-its-way-through-nyc\"><strong>&apos;EMERGENCY&apos; LEFT-WING NYC&#xA0;PROTEST AGAINST SESSIONS FIRING&#xA0;HEADS THROUGH UNION SQUARE&#xA0;-- HIGH ON ENERGY, IRONY</strong></a>\n\nTrump, who spent nearly an hour Thursday at the&#xA0;Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. -- where tables were lined with miniature pumpkin pies ahead of Thanksgiving -- said he has some plans to potentially visit U.S. troops stationed&#xA0;in Iraq and Afghanistan for the first time.\n\n&quot;Well, I think you will see that happen,&quot; the president said, after Wallace noted that Obama and former President George W.

                    "text": "President Trump, speaking exclusively to Fox News&apos Chris Wallace in a wide-ranging interview, revealed what President Obama told him was the biggest challenge facing the U.S.,\u00a0discussed pending high-level departures from his administration\u00a0and admitted that he occasionally enjoys calling on CNN reporter Jim Acosta.\n\"Actually I like to do it, but in many cases I don\u2019t,\" Trump acknowledged. In ruling that the administration temporarily has to restore Acosta&aposs White House access pass on Fifth Amendment due process grounds, federal judge\u00a0Timothy J. Kelly noted that Trump could simply choose to ignore the combative reporter. (Kelly, in his preliminary decision, did not rule on CNN&aposs First Amendment claim.)\nBut Trump, speaking to Wallace, floated another idea for handling Acosta, who frequently spars with the president at length during press conferences.\n\"I think one of the things we\u2019ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don\u2019t have any air time, although I\u2019ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows,\" Trump mused.\u00a0\"I mean, with this stuff you never know what\u2019s going to happen.\"\nCalling Acosta \"unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who\u2019s a wonderful woman,\" Trump said his administration is currently formulating \"rules and regulations\" for White House reporters. \"And if he misbehaves, we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference,\" the president added.\n\nTrump also defended\u00a0Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker against Democrats&apos calls that he should recuse himself because he has written critically of Special Counsel Robert Mueller&aposs probe, which he said in 2017 was at risk of becoming a \"political fishing expedition.\"\n\"I did not know that,\" Trump said, when asked if he was aware prior to appointing him that Whitaker had argued\u00a0Mueller was coming close to exceeding his authority. \"I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\"\nFOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: WHITAKER TELLS SEN. GRAHAM HE SEES NO NEED TO RECUSE HIMSELF\nTrump added that he \"would not get involved\" in Whitaker&aposs decisions as he oversees Mueller&aposs probe in his new role as head of the Justice Department. The DOJ&aposs Office of Legal Counsel\u00a0issued an opinion affirming the constitutionality of Whitaker&aposs temporary\u00a0appointment without Senate approval.\n\"Look he -- it\u2019s going to be up to him,\" Trump said. \"I think he\u2019s very well aware politically.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s astute politically.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very smart person.\u00a0 A very respected person.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right.\u00a0 I really believe he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right.\"\n\nThe president added that he has personally responded to Mueller&aposs written questions in the Russia probe and that they would be submitted \"very soon.\" Trump said his team is \"writing what I tell them to write\" in response to the inquiries.\nTrump emphasized, however, that he probably would not sit for an in-person interview with Mueller, amid fears voiced by his attorneys that the could be tricked into a so-called \"perjury trap\" in which, even if the president is honest, his version of events differs from other witness accounts enough to trigger a criminal prosecution.\n\"We\u2019ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is, probably, that\u00a0we\u2019re finished,\" Trump said.\nHe continued:\u00a0\"We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn\u2019t have even been asked, and I think that should solve the problem. I hope it solves the problem, if it doesn\u2019t, you know, I\u2019ll be told and we\u2019ll make a decision at that time. But probably this is the end.\"\nSEN. FLAKE VOWS TO BOYCOTT GOP JUDICIAL NOMINEES UNLESS MUELLER PROTECTION LEGISLATION GETS A VOTE -- BUT GOP RAISES CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES\nTurning to another one of his frequent critics -- former President Barack Obama -- Trump took something of a victory lap, following news that some of the top candidates Obama had\u00a0backed in the midterm elections had come up short.\n\"I won against President Obama and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama in a great state called Georgia for the governor,\" Trump said, referring to defeated Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams&apos top surrogates. \"And it was all stacked against Brian [Kemp], and I was the one that went for Brian, and Brian won.\" (Abrams acknowledged in a fiery speech this week that she would not win the race, but strongly suggested Republican Brian Kemp had prevailed because of voter suppression, and vowed a lawsuit.)\n\"Look at Florida,\" Trump continued.\u00a0\"I went down to Florida.\u00a0[GOP Senate candidate] Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end.\u00a0 And if I didn\u2019t put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have\u00a0lost that election, OK?\u00a0 In my opinion he would have lost.\u00a0 They would have taken that election away from him. Rick Scott won Florida.\"\nThe results of a manual recount in the Florida Senate were reported on Sunday, and Scott prevailed over Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, following a series of lawsuits and snafus that exposed long-running issues with ballot counting in the state. In the gubernatorial race, Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded this weekend in his close fight with Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\nFLORIDA ELECTION BOSS SAYS RACISM MAY BE REASON SHE&aposS CRITICIZED FOR INCOMPETENCE, POTENTIAL FRAUD\nBut Trump also revealed that Obama, who also campaigned against Trump in several other states,\u00a0had offered him some important guidance in the White House shortly after his\u00a02016 election.\n\"I think North Korea\u2019s been very tough because you know we were very close.\u00a0When I took that over -- President Obama right in those two chairs, we sat and talked and he said that\u2019s by far the biggest problem that this country has,\" Trump told Wallace.\u00a0 \"And I think we had real decision as to which way to go on North Korea and certainly at least so far I\u2019m very happy with the way we went.\"\nAddressing national security matters, Trump told Wallace that he has been briefed on the audio recording of journalist Jamal Khashoggi&aposs apparent murder in Turkey, but said he hasn&apost listened to it, calling it a\u00a0\"suffering tape\" that he was advised not to hear.\n\"You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\" He also said it \"takes two to tango\" to resolve the conflict in Yemen, where Iranian-backed insurgents are facing off in a proxy war\u00a0against Saudi-backed forces,\u00a0noting that \"I want Saudi to stop,\u00a0but I want Iran to stop also.\"\nTrump went on to defend his administration&aposs decision to pull hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Pakistan, saying the country doesn&apost do \"a damn thing for us\" and charging that its government helped terror leader Osama bin Laden\u00a0hide there.\n\"You know, living \u2013 think of this \u2013 living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan in what I guess they considered a nice mansion, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve seen nicer,\" Trump said, referring to bin Laden and his former compound in\u00a0Abbottabad, Pakistan.\u00a0The compound was demolished shortly after United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group forces, in a daring late-night helicopter raid, killed bin Laden there in 2011.\n\"But living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there,\" he added.\u00a0 \"And we give Pakistan $1.3 billion a year . ... [bin Laden] lived in Pakistan, we\u2019re supporting Pakistan, we\u2019re giving them $1.3 billion a year -- which we don\u2019t give them anymore, by the way.\u00a0I ended it because they don\u2019t do anything for us, they don\u2019t do a damn thing for us.\"\nTrump also characterized Adm. William H. McRaven, who oversaw the operation to kill bin Laden, as a \"Hillary Clinton fan\" when Wallace mentioned that he has criticized Trump&aposs harsh rhetoric on the media as a major threat to democracy. McRaven was on Clinton&aposs shortlist for vice president in 2016 and has praised her publicly.\n\"Wouldn&apost it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\u201d Trump asked Wallace, seemingly attacking either McRaven or Pakistani officials.\nAnd Trump sounded a note of regret for not visiting Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C., on Veterans Day -- which Obama did several times when\u00a0he was in office.\n\"I should have done that,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling, as you know. ...\u00a0\u00a0I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year.\u00a0 But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American cemetery in Paris and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things.\"\n&aposEMERGENCY&apos LEFT-WING NYC\u00a0PROTEST AGAINST SESSIONS FIRING\u00a0HEADS THROUGH UNION SQUARE\u00a0-- HIGH ON ENERGY, IRONY\nTrump, who spent nearly an hour Thursday at the\u00a0Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. -- where tables were lined with miniature pumpkin pies ahead of Thanksgiving -- said he has some plans to potentially visit U.S. troops stationed\u00a0in Iraq and Afghanistan for the first time.\n\"Well, I think you will see that happen,\" the president said, after Wallace noted that Obama and former President George W. Bush had each visited soldiers in war zones.\u00a0\"There are things that are being planned.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to talk about it because of -- obviously because of security reasons and everything else.\"\n\nExplaining why he canceled a trip to visit a World War I memorial ceremony in Paris, Trump cited the weather and sharply criticized the media for making a \"big deal\" out of the situation. The president noted he attended an event the next day in the rain at a cemetery just\u00a0outside Paris on Armistice Day.\n\"They said, &aposSir,&apos the Secret Service said, &aposSir, you cannot go. We are not prepared. You cannot go,&apos\" Trump said.\u00a0\"Because it was supposed to be helicopter, but the helicopter couldn\u2019t fly because of zero visibility.\"\nCalling media reports that he is bitter and resentful following the midterm elections nothing more than \"disgusting fake news,\" Trump next addressed some potential high-level departures from his administration.\nOn Department of Homeland Security head\u00a0Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump suggested he wants to see an improvement on border security. The first members of a large Central American migrant caravan arrived in the Mexican city of Tijuana last week and were photographed\u00a0attempting to climb a border fence there.\n\n\"Well, I like her a lot.\u00a0I respect her a lot,\" Trump said, referring to Nielsen.\u00a0\"She\u2019s very smart.\u00a0 I want her to get much tougher and we\u2019ll see what happens there.\u00a0But I want to be extremely tough. ...\u00a0\u00a0I like her very much, I respect her very much, I\u2019d like her to be much tougher on the border -- much tougher, period.\"\nHe added there&aposs a \"chance\" that Nielsen, who was accosted in a restaurant this summer by far-left progressive activists as her security detail kept close watch,\u00a0will continue in her role.\nTrump definitively told Wallace that Chief of Staff John Kelly\u00a0will \"move on\" at some point, even as he claimed\u00a0there was still some chance Kelly will\u00a0stay\u00a0with the administration through 2020.\n\"There are certain things I love what he does,\" the president said.\u00a0\"And there are certain things that I don\u2019t like that he does -- that aren\u2019t his strength.\u00a0It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t do -- you know he works so hard. He\u2019s doing an excellent job in many ways.\u00a0There are a couple of things where it\u2019s just not his strength.\u00a0It\u2019s not his fault, it\u2019s not his strength. ...\u00a0But John, at some point, is going to want to move on.\u00a0John will move on.\"\nMultiple reports have suggested that Vice President Mike Pence&aposs chief of staff,\u00a0Nick Ayers, will replace Kelly.\n\nAnd on Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel, whom the White House announced would depart her role this week, Trump offered a blunt assessment.\n\"I met with Mira two days ago, and we\u2019re going to move her around,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"She was with me for a long time, although I don\u2019t know her.\u00a0 She\u2019s really somebody I don\u2019t know very well.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to move her around because she\u2019s got certain talents.

We would have been at war with North Korea if, let\u2019s say, that administration continued forward.\"\nTrump continued: \"I would give myself, I would \u2013 look, I hate to do it, but I will do it, I would give myself an A+, is that enough? Can I go higher than that?\""
