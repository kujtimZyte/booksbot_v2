The Oval Office has, after all, hosted slave owners and adulterers, accused sexual predators and liars, thugs and warmongers — men who would preach goodness and morality, yet live&nbsp;(and often govern)&nbsp;by a separate code.</p><p>Many were the types of men who would never use the Lord's name in vain during intercourse with their mistresses.</p><p></p><div></div><p>Most of these men, however, maintained an outward air of humility. Abraham Lincoln, shortly before he was nominated as the Republican candidate for president, wrote in a letter to a newspaper editor: "I do not think myself fit for the presidency."</p><p>Ronald Reagan famously held such esteem for the post that he wouldn't enter the Oval Office without wearing a jacket and tie. And even Richard Nixon, in a 1974 television campaign ad in support of&nbsp;Barry Goldwater, said:&nbsp;"With all the power that a president has, the most important thing to bear in mind is this: You must not give power to a man unless, above everything else, he has character."</p><div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a data-contentid="" class="similarLink" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-pipe-bombs-cnn-midterms-democrats-1.4879122"><div class="label labelText label-Updated flag"><span class="labelText label-updated">Updated</span></div><span class="similarLinkText">'Tragedy is nonpartisan': How Trump's handling of the pipe bombs could impact U.S. midterms</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a data-contentid="" class="similarLink" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/democrats-cnn-pipe-bombs-1.4877458"><span class="similarLinkText">Investigators dig for bomb motive, search postal facility in Florida</span></a></li></ul></span></div><p>Hypocrisy aside, throughout all the years of the U.S. presidency, there was generally a recognition that the office and its&nbsp;message was&nbsp;more important than the individual. Until now.</p><p></p><p>There's no&nbsp;humility — contrived or otherwise —&nbsp;with U.S. President Donald Trump. No deference to the esteem of the office or wider appeal for charity or goodness. In a perverse way, Trump actually embodies what he champions.</p><p>Previous presidents preached morality while their administrations tortured prisoners; Trump preaches hate while mocking <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-reporter-with-disability-1.3338267" target="_blank">a disabled reporter</a> and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-mocking-testimony-1.4848230">sexual assault survivor</a>.

This is less a criticism than an observation:&nbsp;Trump doesn't appear to <em>want</em> to steer the ethical&nbsp;course of the nation. Indeed, he's less a moral steward of the American conscience&nbsp;than an uncritical&nbsp;reflection.</p><p>Trump's supporters might argue that it's preferable to have an authentically depraved president than who preaches compassion and decency, then fails his own standard.</p><p>But to completely abandon the notion — OK, the ideal — of the president as the nation's moral custodian is to suggest that words alone can't have influence.&nbsp;(They can.) And it's to suggest that appealing to a higher standard is futile unless it is going to be met. (It's not.)</p><p>Many Americans still take their cues from the edicts of the person occupying the Oval Office. Ideally, he'd strive for better, not simply reflect the worst.</p><hr><p><strong><em>This column is part of&nbsp;CBC's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion" target="_blank">Opinion section.</a>&nbsp;For more information about this section, please read this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/community/editorsblog/2016/11/a-new-destination-for-debate-at-cbcnewsca.html" target="_blank">editor's&nbsp;blog</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/1.3834532" target="_blank">our&nbsp;FAQ</a>.</em></strong></p></span></div></div><div class="authorprofile"><h2 class="sectionTitle"><span class="sectionTitleText">About the Author</span></h2><div class="authorprofile-container"><div class="authorprofile-image-container"><span class="imageMedia author-image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage aspect-100"></div><img alt="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3850814.1484834768!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/robyn-urback.jpg" class="loaded largeImage"></div></span></div><div class="authorprofile-name-container"><p class="authorprofile-name">Robyn Urback</p><p class="authorprofile-title">Columnist</p></div></div><p class="authorprofile-biography">Robyn Urback is an opinion columnist with CBC News and a producer with the CBC's Opinion section.
