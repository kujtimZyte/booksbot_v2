In a press conference, Mr Sessions said Mr Sayoc faced up to 58 years\nin prison if found guilty.\n\n\u201cWe will not tolerate such lawlessness, especially political violence,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nSeveral moments later, however, the Justice Department said Mr Sessions had\ninaccurate information about the alleged bomber\u2019s prison time. Mr\u00a0Sayoc\u00a0faces\n48 years in prison, not 58.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if there are other suspects, FBI Director Christopher Wray\u00a0said the\ninvestigation is active\u00a0and ongoing. Officials believe there may be other\nexplosive devices in the mail system.\n\nThe federal authorities were able to find Mr\u00a0Sayoc\u00a0after finding a fingerprint\non one of the envelopes sent to California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, which\nhas been confirmed to belong to him, Wray said. Investigators also believe\nthere is DNA on other packages Mr\u00a0Sayoc\u00a0sent.\n\nThe authorities also seized Mr\u00a0Sayoc\u2019s white van. The vehicle was covered in\nstickers featuring Mr Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, anti-gay symbols, Ku\nKlux Klan paraphernalia, and a lynching of a black person. One of the stickers\nread \u201cCNN sucks,\u201d echoing a chant often said in Mr Trump\u2019s rallies.\n\nThe prosecutor for Mr Sayoc's case is US Attorney for the Southern District of\nNew York Geoffrey Berman.\n\n\u201cThis is an ongoing and active investigation. We will not rest until these\ncrimes are fully investigated,\u201d Mr Berman said.\n\nMr Sessions said the mail bomb suspect appears to be partisan, but said he\ndoes not know why Democratic political figures were targeted.\n\n##  Shape Created with Sketch.

Ms Ritchie reported him to Twitter.\nThe social media site responded by saying that Mr Sayoc did not commit any\nviolations.\nMr Sayoc\u2019s Facebook page, listed under the name Cesar Altieri Randazzo, is\nfilled with right-wing propaganda. He appeared to have shared posts and\narticles from right-wing pages, Breitbart and Fox News.

Some of the removals were the result of\nFacebook users reporting Mr Sayoc\u2019s posts for violations.
