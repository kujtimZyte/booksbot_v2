In a press conference, Mr Sessions said Mr Sayoc faced up to 58 years in prison if found guilty.\n\n\u201cWe will not tolerate such lawlessness, especially political violence,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral moments later, however, the Justice Department said Mr Sessions had inaccurate information about the alleged bomber\u2019s prison time. Mr\u00a0Sayoc\u00a0faces 48 years in prison, not 58.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen asked if there are other suspects, FBI Director Christopher Wray\u00a0said the investigation is active\u00a0and ongoing. Officials believe there may be other explosive devices in the mail system.\n\nThe federal authorities were able to find Mr\u00a0Sayoc\u00a0after finding a fingerprint on one of the envelopes sent to California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, which has been confirmed to belong to him, Wray said. Investigators also believe there is DNA on other packages Mr\u00a0Sayoc\u00a0sent.\n\nThe authorities also seized Mr\u00a0Sayoc\u2019s white van. The vehicle was covered in stickers featuring Mr Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, anti-gay symbols, Ku Klux Klan paraphernalia, and a lynching of a black person. One of the stickers read \u201cCNN sucks,\u201d echoing a chant often said in Mr Trump\u2019s rallies.\u00a0\n\nThe prosecutor for Mr Sayoc's case is US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman.\n\n\u201cThis is an ongoing and active investigation. We will not rest until these crimes are fully investigated,\u201d Mr Berman said.\n\nMr Sessions said the mail bomb suspect appears to be partisan, but said he does not know why Democratic political figures were targeted.\u00a0\n\n##  Shape Created with Sketch.
