In January, Washington\u2019s governor declared a state of emergency to help curb an outbreak that included [71 cases \u2014 ](https://www.clark.wa.gov/public-health/measles-investigation)the vast majority of which were in unvaccinated individuals.

[A 2013 study](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/5/e1397) of parents in Clark County, Washington, found that roughly 70 percent of vaccine-hesitant parents had someone in their social network who was dissuading them from following standard vaccination schedules, suggesting those voices and conversations can be highly influential.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that people are getting information from all kinds of different sources,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cParents don\u2019t get to spend very much time, unfortunately, with their kids\u2019 pediatricians.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we elevate the voice of science?\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m speaking about vaccines, and someone down the road who didn\u2019t go to medical school, who didn\u2019t do residency, who doesn\u2019t understand vaccines and hasn\u2019t taken care of a child with infectious disease or with a life-threatening vaccine-preventable disease, if they\u2019re talking on Facebook, and I\u2019m talking on Facebook, how do we help the reader in some way know the difference?\u201d\n\nIn response to the AAP letters, a spokesperson for Pinterest told HuffPost the company will \u201ccontinue to use AAP resources to guide our work and look forward to continuing our conversation with them.\u201d (A spokesperson for Google declined to comment specifically on the AAP\u2019s letter, and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.)\n\n![There are many reasons why parents choose not to vaccinate, according to Wendy Sue Swanson, a Seattle pediatrician.](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c82e0542500009803c8bd35.jpeg?cache=Y3qEQEBiZy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale)\n\nKarl Tapales via Getty Images\n\nThere are many reasons why parents choose not to vaccinate, according to Wendy Sue Swanson, a Seattle pediatrician.\n\nBut the companies appear to be acknowledging their role in the spread of vaccine misinformation.
