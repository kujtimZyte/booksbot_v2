A [blog\npost](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/internet-vulnerability-takes-down-google/)\npublished by network intelligence firm ThousandEyes observed:\n\n> This incident at a minimum caused a massive denial of service to G Suite and\nGoogle Search. However, this also put valuable Google traffic in the hands of\nISPs in countries with a long history of Internet surveillance. Overall\nThousandEyes detected over 180 prefixes affected by this route leak, which\ncovers a vast scope of Google services. Our analysis indicates that the origin\nof this leak was the BGP peering relationship between MainOne, the Nigerian\nprovider, and China Telecom. MainOne has a peering relationship with Google\nvia IXPN in Lagos and has direct routes to Google, which leaked into China\nTelecom. While we don\u2019t know if this was a misconfiguration or a malicious\nact, these leaked routes propagated from China Telecom, via TransTelecom to\nNTT and other transit ISPs. We also noticed that this leak was primarily\npropagated by business-grade transit providers and did not impact consumer ISP\nnetworks as much.\n\nIXPN refers to the [Internet Exchange Point of Nigeria](http://ixp.net.ng/),\nwhere regional ISPs with peering agreements meet to exchange traffic free of\ncharge. The existence of peering agreements between Google and MainOne and\nCloudflare and MainOne further supports the assurances the routing mishap\nwasn\u2019t intentional.\n\nReaders are reminded that the border gateway protocol that routes Internet\ntraffic from autonomous system to autonomous system around the globe is as\nfragile as it is intricate. While its foundation of trust was never designed\nto withstand the hostile actors that so often populate today\u2019s Internet, the\nintricacies of BGP are enough to make major blunders a fact of life. While\nit\u2019s too early to declare this routing mishap an accident, indications at this\npoint aren\u2019t supporting the suspicions this was a deliberate hijacking.\n\nEither way, the event and its ability to go undetected until end users began\nto report dropped traffic underscores the continued inability of major\nproviders to address the performance and security limitations of BGP.\n\n\"Through a small Nigerian ISP, Google's prefixes were leaked to worldwide Tier\n1 carriers, bringing traffic to a halt,\" Kris Slevens, a technical account\nengineer specializing in network security at Continuous Networks, told Ars.\n\"This still shows that China Telecom hasn't reined in their infrastructure for\nany type of filtering, and how inherently fragile BGP is being based on trust.\nAlso with a paper coming out last week about [China Telecom's] past with\ntraffic rerouting, this isn't new. And more important, peering exchanges need\nstricter prefix limits or filtering. That is highly overlooked.\"\n\n[](/author/dan-goodin)\n\n",

The existence of peering agreements between Google and MainOne and\nCloudflare and MainOne further supports the assurances the routing mishap\nwasn\u2019t intentional.\nReaders are reminded that the border gateway protocol that routes Internet\ntraffic from autonomous system to autonomous system around the globe is as\nfragile as it is intricate. While its foundation of trust was never designed\nto withstand the hostile actors that so often populate today\u2019s Internet, the\nintricacies of BGP are enough to make major blunders a fact of life. While\nit\u2019s too early to declare this routing mishap an accident, indications at this\npoint aren\u2019t supporting the suspicions this was a deliberate hijacking.\nEither way, the event and its ability to go undetected until end users began\nto report dropped traffic underscores the continued inability of major\nproviders to address the performance and security limitations of BGP.\n\"Through a small Nigerian ISP, Google's prefixes were leaked to worldwide Tier\n1 carriers, bringing traffic to a halt,\" Kris Slevens, a technical account\nengineer specializing in network security at Continuous Networks, told Ars.\n\"This still shows that China Telecom hasn't reined in their infrastructure for\nany type of filtering, and how inherently fragile BGP is being based on trust.\nAlso with a paper coming out last week about [China Telecom's] past with\ntraffic rerouting, this isn't new. And more important, peering exchanges need\nstricter prefix limits or filtering. That is highly overlooked.\"\n"
