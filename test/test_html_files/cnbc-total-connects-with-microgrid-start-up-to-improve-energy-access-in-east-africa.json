With an agile and efficient economic model, Powerhive has sparked\nthe inter-est of Total, which aims to expand access to energy with its Better\nEnergy initiative._\n\nAround 1.5 billion people in the world have little or no access to\nelectricity. This [map published by the World\nBank](http://donnees.banquemondiale.org/indicateur/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS/countries?display=map\n\"http://donnees.banquemondiale.org/indicateur/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS/countries?display=map\")\nvery clearly shows that the most underserved areas by far are situated in Sub-\nSaharan Africa and South-East Asia.  \n\nOf course, there are some electrification projects already in the works in\nthese territories, run by local authorities. But they'll take decades.\nMeanwhile, each year, there are 10 million more Africans looking for access to\nenergy. There is a strong likelihood that Africa will be able to 'skip over'\nthe phase of large-scale electrical infrastructure projects and opt directly\nfor a distributed energy system, produced and consumed locally, much in the\nsame way that it passed directly to mobile telephony without developing\nlandline infrastructure.  \n\n#### Could start-ups be a part of the solution?\n\nYounger, more agile, faster, and more efficient \u2014 new businesses are proposing\nsolutions to improve access to electric-ity for populations in need. Among\nthem is SHS, Solar Home Systems, which builds small networks called Microgrids\nthat produce and distribute electricity, very often using renewable resources\nlike wind and solar.\n\nRead more on the same topic: [Solar kiosks for villages without\nelectricity](/2015/04/23/the-sun-cools-sub-saharan-africa.html)\n\nThe California-based start-up Powerhive has been specializing in microgrid\ntechnology for five years now. How did they do it? The company drew on\nadvances made in solar panels, batteries, electrical equipment and techniques\nlinked to smart meters and mobile payments.\n\nWhile they have not, strictly speaking, made technological innovations of\ntheir own, Powerhive did devise an effective combination of new technologies\ndeveloped by others, adapting them to the particular conditions of their\ntarget markets.\n\nFirst, solar energy has become less expensive and more competitive compared to\nother means of generating electricity. At the same time, satellite\nvisualization tools like Google Maps have made it easier to pinpoint areas\nwhere the popula-tion is most concentrated and identify the optimal locations\nto equip. Finally, from a more technical perspective, the use of LED lighting\nsystems allows for lower energy consumption \u2014 the batteries perform better and\ncan be used with smart meters. Above all, the rate of mobile phone usage is\nvery high. All of these ingredients were in place to suggest a solution in\nwhich the end-user pays in advance for a set quantity of electricity that's\nreliable, affordable, and environ-mentally-friendly. It's the principle of\n\"pay-as-you-go.\"\n\nRead more on the same topic: [BBOX, a new player in the access to energy in\nAfrica](/2015/11/26/boosting-business-with-solar.html)\n\nPowerhive combined individually simple components in an innovative way, adding\na strong field presence to the mix. They were able to convince local\nauthorities to grant them development licenses authorizing them to generate,\ndeliver, and sell electricity to local populations. Their solution has made\nPowerhive the number-one private company and the number-two provider of\nelectricity in Kenya today.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n#### A natural partnership with Total\n\nWhen you have a network of 4 million gas stations in Africa; when you have a\nstrong vision for the expansion of access to electricity; when your aim is to\nbecome one of the top three providers of renewable electricity within several\nyears, you can't help but be seduced by Powerhive's offering. It is for these\nreasons that [Total Energy Ventures](http://fr.total.com/fr/pour-une-\nmeilleure-energie/projets-internationaux/total-energy-ventures-innover-avec-\nles-startups \"http://fr.total.com/fr/pour-une-meilleure-energie/projets-\ninternationaux/total-energy-ventures-innover-avec-les-startups\") invested in\nthe California-based start-up at the end of 2015.\n\n\"Powerhive was looking at Total with a great deal of interest,\" confides\nEmmanuel Courcier, senior Investment Man-ager at Total Energy Ventures. \"Its\nfounders saw us as the pre-eminent energy provider \u2014 present in Africa and\ncarry-ing a true message of development in energy access. Powerhive wanted to\nhave Total as a partner, and we've done it!\"\n\nIt's a partnership that could take multiple forms, like envisioning the use of\ngas stations as anchoring points for a mi-crogrid platform, or using the\npresence of an established provider to accelerate projects, and ambitions.\n\n\"One Powerhive project \u2014 that's 100 villages, 20,000 homes and 100,000 people\nimpacted. With 10 projects, we're talking about a million people,\" specifies\nEmmanuel Courcier. \"Tomorrow, we can easily imagine that these decentral-ized\nand autonomous installations could be connected to a main network, giving it\nstability by alleviating some of its workload.\n\nAn approach equally in line with the vision of Better Energy. Providing\ndecentralized and renewable electricity will enable the replacement of\nkerosene and spirit lamps or diesel generators, all of which have the\nunfortunate pitfalls of being expensive, polluting, not readily available, and\nharmful to human health.\n\nCourcier is \"proud to be a part of these projects. We are all convinced that\nthey will be viable in the long term, that they will be successful, and that\nthey'll bring a great deal to the populations concerned.\"\n\nTotal Energy Ventures has invested in two start-ups whose economic models are\nsimilar: [Off Grid Electric](http://offgrid-electric.com/#home \"http\n://offgrid-electric.com/#home\") and [Powerhive](http://www.powerhive.com/\n\"http://www.powerhive.com/\"). \"There are many needs in many countries and\nthere will be room for everybody.
