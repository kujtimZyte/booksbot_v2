We have noted that the Indonesian coordinating security minister, Minister Wiranto has issued an official statement which I think was referred to in your report, which says that the President has ordered now an in-depth study to be conducted before any decision will be made. \n\nSo we're seeking further details about that review. \n\nBut we have been very clear in our concerns that this person, it is imperative that he never be allowed, he never be in a position to incite others to carry out other future attacks against innocent civilians as was the case previously. \n\nKIM LANDERS: Is the review a feather in the cap for the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, given that he urged Indonesia to show respect for Australia when it came to this case?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: I wouldn't describe it like that at all. \n\nThese are matters for the Indonesian processes of government and of law enforcement.\n\nBut what we have been focused on is ensuring that we maintain a very strong counterterrorism partnership with Indonesia. \n\nWe know as one of our nearest neighbors, that is extremely important for us both as individual nations bilaterally and most importantly or equally importantly, regionally, that commitment to counterterrorism is fundamental. \n\nKIM LANDERS: If I could take you to the case of the Australian resident and refugee Hakeem al-Araibi who's been detained in Thailand for nearly 60 days. \n\nHe's facing deportation to Bahrain, a country that he fled. You've been lobbying for his release. \n\nDo you have any progress to report?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: Kim, we are very deeply concerned by the ongoing detention of Mr al-Araibi in Thailand. \n\nI visited Bangkok myself, 10 days ago or so to meet with both the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Justice and the Minister for Foreign Affairs so we have most definitely ensured that the Thai government is well aware, at all levels, of the great importance of this matter to Australia. \n\nWe are making extensive efforts to seek his safe return. \n\nKIM LANDERS: Did the Australian Federal Police through officers seconded to Interpol in Thailand facilitate his arrest, even though an Interpol red notice isn't supposed to be allowed against refugees if it's requested by the country where they fear persecution?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: Kim, I'm absolutely focused on securing Mr al-Araibi's release. \n\nI understand there are concerns in relation to that matter. The red notice ...\n\nKIM LANDERS: But did the Australian Federal Police help alert Thai authorities to his travel plans?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: The red notice was issued just by Bahrain just before he travelled from Australia to India. It actually didn't comply with Interpol's constitution and it was cancelled as soon as Australia confirmed that Mr al-Araibi was a refugee. \n\nAs a refugee, I am absolutely focused on trying to achieve his release from detention in Indonesia and his safe return, in Thailand and his safe return to Australia and to his wife. \n\nKIM LANDERS: If I could bring you to politics here at home. In your state of New South Wales, your party is preparing the way to parachute the former Labor president, Warren Mundine into the marginal seat of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast.\n\nHe doesn't live in the seat, he's not a member of the Liberal Party, he wasn't endorsed by locals, so why do this?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: Well, I think it is a great achievement that Warren Mundine has determined that he would like to join our team. \n\nHe wants to be part of a government that is going to keep the economy strong and to focus on the things that matter to everyday Australians and particularly the Australians in Gilmore. \n\nKIM LANDERS: But the man who was the locally endorsed candidate has now quit and he has labelled the Liberal Party undemocratic. \n\nHow is that good?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: He has, well, I think the question you asked me was particularly in relation to Warren Mundine, a man who's demonstrated leadership ability over many decades in the Indigenous community and much more broadly across Australia. \n\nHe has very strong connections and I think in the Gilmore community he'll be a champion for those people and for Indigenous people of the community as well which I think is a great message for the Liberal Party and for Australia. \n\nKIM LANDERS: Could the intervention result in the Liberals losing this seat?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: Well, every single seat, Kim, is a challenge in its selection and in every other. \n\nI live in a part of Sydney, in Western Sydney, where we are always faced with significant challenges to win and retain seats, so we don't take anything for granted.\n\nAnd I look forward to working closely with Warren, with the Prime Minister and the team to make sure that Gilmore stays in Liberal hands, to make sure that the government, which is focused on being- keeping the economy strong and on what matters to Australians, is able to continue our work. \n\nKIM LANDERS: You're the Liberal Party's most senior minister, after the news of Kelly O'Dwyer's shock resignation, what concrete measures can the party take to address its gender imbalance?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: Well, I'd like to say, the first opportunity to say in relation to my very good friend Kelly O'Dwyer, what a fabulous colleague and cabinet minister she is and continues to be.\n\nAnd of course we are disappointed with her decision but absolutely acknowledge that every single family makes its own decisions about career. \n\nIn relation to women in the Liberal Party, I am firmly on the record as saying I'd like to see more women participating at the highest levels of the party, seeking preselection, winning preselection and winning seats - something I've been focused on for many years. \n\nThere is more to be done, there is no doubt about that ...\n\nKIM LANDERS: But exactly what, what is going to be done though?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: Well, I think that we've successfully pursued this in the past and we need to do it again. \n\nWe need to be very focused, seat by seat and frankly, individual by individual on making sure that we are encouraging and bringing women forward who are able to participate at the highest levels and ensuring that they are able to win those pre-selections and then win those seats. \n\nKIM LANDERS: Well, Kelly O'Dwyer had put her own money into a fighting fund to get more Liberal women into politics. What are you willing to do?\n\nMARISE PAYNE: Well, I think the Enid Lyons fighting fund is a fabulous entity.\n\nI have made a contribution myself and we'll look forward to supporting those women who are part of our team going forward. \n\nOver 22 women pre-selected around Australia and here in, as I said, in Western Sydney I am working with Melissa McIntosh in the key seat of Lindsay - where Labor has completely let down the community with its dysfunction in the key seat of Macquarie - to make sure that, with Sarah Richards there as the Liberal candidate, to make sure we have the best people going out to the community and persuading them to support them. \n\nThey are fabulous women and I look forward to working with them. \n\nKIM LANDERS: Okay, Minister, thank you very much for joining AM. \n\nMARISE PAYNE: Thanks Kim. \n\nKIM LANDERS: And that is the Foreign Minister. Marise Payne.\n\n##  Credits \n\n  * **Reporter** **[Kim Landers](/news/kim-landers/8239940)**\n\n\n\n",
