Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, was meant to be delivered to the New York offices of CNN, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan on Friday, police officials said. Jeenah Moon for The New York Times](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/27/nyregion/27bombs21/27bombs21-superJumbo.jpg)\nAn outspoken supporter of President Trump from South Florida was charged on Friday with sending explosive packages to at least a dozen of the president\u2019s critics, apparently bringing to a close an attempted bombing spree that has gripped the country just ahead of the midterm elections.\nThe suspect, Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr., 56, was arrested outside an auto parts store near Fort Lauderdale after a fast-moving investigation in which the authorities said they were able to pull a fingerprint from one of the bomb packages and collect Mr. Sayoc\u2019s DNA from two others.\nMr. Sayoc, who seemed to be living out of a van in Aventura, Fla., was taken into custody on a day when four more explosive packages were found, including two intended for United States senators, both Democrats.\nA federal criminal complaint spells out his contempt for this week\u2019s many bomb targets, noting that Mr. Sayoc\u2019s van was slathered with images and slogans often found on fringe right-wing social media accounts.\nThe complaint identifies a Twitter account that authorities said he used to rail against Democratic figures, and it notes that both his social media messages and the bomb packages used the same misspelling \u2014 \u201cHilary Clinton\u201d \u2014 for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent.\nMr. Sayoc also posted frequently on right-wing social media groups, the authorities said. On Facebook, Mr. Sayoc published photos of a Trump rally he attended during the 2016 presidential campaign. He was wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.\n![Cesar Sayoc Jr. Broward County Sheriff's Office](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/27/nyregion/27bomb11/27bomb11-popup.jpg)\nOf the four bombs discovered on Friday, one was addressed to Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat; another was sent to James R. Clapper Jr., a former director of national intelligence; and a third was intercepted before it reached Senator Kamala Harris, a California Democrat.\nA fourth, found in a mail facility in California, was addressed to Tom Steyer, a prominent Democratic donor, Mr. Steyer said.\nIn all, Mr. Sayoc is believed to have sent at least 14 bombs to 12 targets, [all of whom](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/nyregion/who-received-pipe-bombs-explosives.html) are regularly disparaged by the right.\nAt a news conference in Washington, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Mr. Sayoc had been charged with five federal crimes, including the interstate transportation of an explosive, the illegal mailing of explosives and making a threat against a former president and others.\nThe packages sent by Mr. Sayoc included photographs of his intended targets, each one marked with a red X, according to the criminal complaint.\nWhen asked why Mr. Sayoc had sent the bombs to Democrats, Mr. Sessions said that he was not sure, but added that the suspect \u201cappears to be a partisan.\u201d\nThe F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, said that the bureau was still trying to determine if Mr. Sayoc\u2019s bombs were \u201cfunctional\u201d but noted that they contained \u201cenergetic material\u201d that could be dangerous. Mr. Wray said that the investigation was \u201cactive\u201d and cautioned that there could be more bombs still undiscovered.\nSpeaking at the White House earlier on Friday, [Mr. Trump praised law enforcement officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/us/politics/trump-bomb-media.html) for quickly arresting a suspect.\n\u201cThese terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,\u201d he said.\nBut in a Friday night rally in Charlotte, N.C., the president accused the news media of trying to use Mr. Sayoc\u2019s political leanings to \u201cscore political points against me and the Republican Party.\u201d\n\u201cThe media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement to give power back to the people,\u201d he said.\nMr. Sayoc is a registered Republican whose arrest record in Florida dates back to 1991 and includes felony theft, drug and fraud charges, as well as allegations that he threatened to use a bomb, public records show.\nHis criminal history from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicates that he listed his occupation some years ago as \u201cmanager.\u201d\nAccording to a 2012 bankruptcy petition filed in Miami, Mr. Sayoc resided at the time at his mother\u2019s home. \u201cLives w/mom,\u201d a handwritten note on the petition said. \u201cHas no furniture.\u201d\n[[Read more on what we know about the suspect, Cesar Sayoc Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/us/cesar-sayoc-bombing-suspect-arrested.html)]\nMr. Sayoc was arrested around 11 a.m. Friday outside an AutoZone car repair shop in Plantation, Fla., about 20 miles from Aventura, officials said. Patrol cars shut down the surrounding streets, leaving rows of businesses inaccessible for part of the morning. The authorities also seized and towed away Mr. Sayoc\u2019s white van, where he was apparently living.\nSome residents of Aventura reported seeing a similar white van, the windows of which were plastered with a thick collage of pro-Trump stickers, often parked in the lot of a strip mall, the Shoppes at the Waterways.\n[Photos of the van showed that one of the stickers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/us/bomber-van-stickers-white-trump.html) depicted a heroic Mr. Trump standing in front of flames and the American flag. Another was of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s face in the cross hairs of a rifle scope. A third said: \u201cCNN Sucks.\u201d\n\u201cIt struck me because of the crazy, conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,\u201d said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer who until recently lived in Aventura and often noticed the van. \u201cIt was unsettling, and also it seemed to be occupied. Sometimes the door would be ajar or a window would be open, which indicated to me that maybe somebody was living in the van.\u201d\nThe criminal complaint against Mr. Sayoc was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, where he will be prosecuted. Five of the bombs sent this week fall under the jurisdiction of federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\nMr. Sayoc is expected to appear before a judge in Florida on Monday.\nA lawyer from the Federal Defenders office in Manhattan, Sarah Baumgartel, was assigned to represent him. \u201cWe hope that he will be presented in court and brought to New York expeditiously so that the case can proceed,\u201d Ms. Baumgartel said.\nFor months now, Mr. Trump has been attacking the F.B.I., ridiculing its officials and damaging morale at the bureau.\nThe swift arrest on Friday was a public win for Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and a reminder of his agency\u2019s effectiveness.\n![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/26/autossell/COVER_v1_onsite/COVER_v1_onsite-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg)\n![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/04/us/00LAQUAN-HFO/00LAQUAN-HFO-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg)\n![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/arts/26cosby-van/26cosby-van-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v4.jpg)\n![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/autossell/cover/cover-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg)\n![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/26/autossell/COVER_v1_onsite/COVER_v1_onsite-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg)\nCommissioner James P. O\u2019Neill of the New York Police Department also praised the F.B.I., sending a message that the two agencies, along with some half a dozen others that took part in the investigation, were in lock step.\nOne law enforcement official said the investigation came together less than 24 hours before the announcement, with a preliminary DNA match first and the fingerprint match coming sometime Friday morning.\nLater on Friday, federal authorities executed a search warrant at a residence associated with Mr. Sayoc, but he had been living in his van. Agents conducted a preliminary sweep of the vehicle before towing it to the F.B.I. office, where they were expected to search it later on Friday.\nThe official said that during an interview with agents, Mr. Sayoc denied playing any role in the bombing campaign.\n\u201cHe denied all knowledge of making the bombs,\u201d the official said. \u201cAny time they brought up the devices, he wouldn\u2019t say anything about them.\u201d\nMr. Sayoc was first interviewed under a national security exception that allows defendants to be questioned without being advised of their rights to a lawyer.\nAfter he was given his Miranda warnings and told he could have a lawyer, \u201che invoked his right to counsel pretty quickly,\u201d the official said. Mr. Sayoc declined to answer further questions.\n![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/26/autossell/COVER_v1_onsite/COVER_v1_onsite-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg)\n![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/26/nyregion/26Sayoc-arrest/26Sayoc-arrest-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg)\n![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/27/us/politics/27-doj-vid/27-doj-vid-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg)\n![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/25/nyregion/25clinton7/25clinton7-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg)\n![Erin Schaff for The New York Times](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/27/us/politics/27-doj-vid/27-doj-vid-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg)\nOf the packages discovered on Friday, the one addressed to Mr. Clapper, the former senior intelligence official, was meant for the New York offices of CNN, where he works as an analyst, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan, police officials in New York City said.\nThe package addressed to Mr. Booker was found in Florida.\nThe device sent to Ms. Harris\u2019s district office in Sacramento, Calif., was discovered at a mail facility there, she said in a statement on Friday. Mr. Steyer said the device addressed to him had been intercepted at a mail facility in Burlingame, Calif.\nSpeaking on CNN on Friday, Mr. Clapper said he was not surprised that a device had been sent to him.\n[[A look at the contentious words between the president and some of his most outspoken critics](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/nyregion/who-received-pipe-bombs-explosives.html)]\n\u201cThis is definitely domestic terrorism,\u201d Mr. Clapper said. \u201cAnyone who has in any way been a critic, publicly been a critic of President Trump, needs to be on an extra alert.\u201d\nOther packages have been addressed to former President Barack Obama; former Secretary of State Clinton; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat; former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.; John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, the [actor Robert De Niro](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/nyregion/robert-de-niro-trump.html); and George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor.\nAll of the packages had return address labels bearing the misspelled name of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat whose district is in southern Florida. They each were affixed with six first-class stamps, and the explosive devices were contained in plain manila envelopes.\nWhile investigators initially thought that some of the devices were hand delivered, federal officials now believe that all were sent through the mail.\nUsing information collected by the United States Postal Service, investigators had focused their attention on certain Florida postal centers, including one in Opa-locka near Miami.",

Clapper Jr., a former director of national intelligence; and a third was intercepted before it reached Senator Kamala Harris, a California Democrat.\nA fourth, found in a mail facility in California, was addressed to Tom Steyer, a prominent Democratic donor, Mr. Steyer said.\nIn all, Mr. Sayoc is believed to have sent at least 14 bombs to 12 targets, all of whom are regularly disparaged by the right.\nAt a news conference in Washington, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Mr. Sayoc had been charged with five federal crimes, including the interstate transportation of an explosive, the illegal mailing of explosives and making a threat against a former president and others.\nThe packages sent by Mr. Sayoc included photographs of his intended targets, each one marked with a red X, according to the criminal complaint.\nWhen asked why Mr. Sayoc had sent the bombs to Democrats, Mr. Sessions said that he was not sure, but added that the suspect \u201cappears to be a partisan.\u201d\nThe F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, said that the bureau was still trying to determine if Mr. Sayoc\u2019s bombs were \u201cfunctional\u201d but noted that they contained \u201cenergetic material\u201d that could be dangerous. Mr. Wray said that the investigation was \u201cactive\u201d and cautioned that there could be more bombs still undiscovered.\nSpeaking at the White House earlier on Friday, Mr. Trump praised law enforcement officials for quickly arresting a suspect.\n\u201cThese terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,\u201d he said.\nBut in a Friday night rally in Charlotte, N.C., the president accused the news media of trying to use Mr. Sayoc\u2019s political leanings to \u201cscore political points against me and the Republican Party.\u201d\n\u201cThe media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement to give power back to the people,\u201d he said.\nMr. Sayoc is a registered Republican whose arrest record in Florida dates back to 1991 and includes felony theft, drug and fraud charges, as well as allegations that he threatened to use a bomb, public records show.\nHis criminal history from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicates that he listed his occupation some years ago as \u201cmanager.\u201d\nAccording to a 2012 bankruptcy petition filed in Miami, Mr. Sayoc resided at the time at his mother\u2019s home. \u201cLives w/mom,\u201d a handwritten note on the petition said. \u201cHas no furniture.\u201d\n[Read more on what we know about the suspect, Cesar Sayoc Jr.]\nMr. Sayoc was arrested around 11 a.m. Friday outside an AutoZone car repair shop in Plantation, Fla., about 20 miles from Aventura, officials said. Patrol cars shut down the surrounding streets, leaving rows of businesses inaccessible for part of the morning. The authorities also seized and towed away Mr. Sayoc\u2019s white van, where he was apparently living.\nSome residents of Aventura reported seeing a similar white van, the windows of which were plastered with a thick collage of pro-Trump stickers, often parked in the lot of a strip mall, the Shoppes at the Waterways.\nPhotos of the van showed that one of the stickers depicted a heroic Mr. Trump standing in front of flames and the American flag. Another was of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s face in the cross hairs of a rifle scope. A third said: \u201cCNN Sucks.\u201d\n\u201cIt struck me because of the crazy, conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,\u201d said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer who until recently lived in Aventura and often noticed the van. \u201cIt was unsettling, and also it seemed to be occupied. Sometimes the door would be ajar or a window would be open, which indicated to me that maybe somebody was living in the van.\u201d\nThe criminal complaint against Mr. Sayoc was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, where he will be prosecuted. Five of the bombs sent this week fall under the jurisdiction of federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\nMr. Sayoc is expected to appear before a judge in Florida on Monday.\nA lawyer from the Federal Defenders office in Manhattan, Sarah Baumgartel, was assigned to represent him. \u201cWe hope that he will be presented in court and brought to New York expeditiously so that the case can proceed,\u201d Ms. Baumgartel said.\nFor months now, Mr. Trump has been attacking the F.B.I., ridiculing its officials and damaging morale at the bureau.\nThe swift arrest on Friday was a public win for Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and a reminder of his agency\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommissioner James P. O\u2019Neill of the New York Police Department also praised the F.B.I., sending a message that the two agencies, along with some half a dozen others that took part in the investigation, were in lock step.\nOne law enforcement official said the investigation came together less than 24 hours before the announcement, with a preliminary DNA match first and the fingerprint match coming sometime Friday morning.\nLater on Friday, federal authorities executed a search warrant at a residence associated with Mr. Sayoc, but he had been living in his van. Agents conducted a preliminary sweep of the vehicle before towing it to the F.B.I. office, where they were expected to search it later on Friday.\nThe official said that during an interview with agents, Mr. Sayoc denied playing any role in the bombing campaign.\n\u201cHe denied all knowledge of making the bombs,\u201d the official said. \u201cAny time they brought up the devices, he wouldn\u2019t say anything about them.\u201d\nMr. Sayoc was first interviewed under a national security exception that allows defendants to be questioned without being advised of their rights to a lawyer.\nAfter he was given his Miranda warnings and told he could have a lawyer, \u201che invoked his right to counsel pretty quickly,\u201d the official said. Mr. Sayoc declined to answer further questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the packages discovered on Friday, the one addressed to Mr. Clapper, the former senior intelligence official, was meant for the New York offices of CNN, where he works as an analyst, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan, police officials in New York City said.\nThe package addressed to Mr. Booker was found in Florida.\nThe device sent to Ms. Harris\u2019s district office in Sacramento, Calif., was discovered at a mail facility there, she said in a statement on Friday. Mr. Steyer said the device addressed to him had been intercepted at a mail facility in Burlingame, Calif.\nSpeaking on CNN on Friday, Mr. Clapper said he was not surprised that a device had been sent to him.\n[A look at the contentious words between the president and some of his most outspoken critics]\n\u201cThis is definitely domestic terrorism,\u201d Mr. Clapper said. \u201cAnyone who has in any way been a critic, publicly been a critic of President Trump, needs to be on an extra alert.\u201d\nOther packages have been addressed to former President Barack Obama; former Secretary of State Clinton; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat; former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.; John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, the actor Robert De Niro; and George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor.\nAll of the packages had return address labels bearing the misspelled name of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat whose district is in southern Florida. They each were affixed with six first-class stamps, and the explosive devices were contained in plain manila envelopes.\nWhile investigators initially thought that some of the devices were hand delivered, federal officials now believe that all were sent through the mail.\nUsing information collected by the United States Postal Service, investigators had focused their attention on certain Florida postal centers, including one in Opa-locka near Miami."
