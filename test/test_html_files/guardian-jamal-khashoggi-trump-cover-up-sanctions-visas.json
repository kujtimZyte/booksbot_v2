It was carried out poorly and the cover-up was one of the worst in the history of cover-ups.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBecause whoever thought of that idea, I think is in big trouble. And they should be in big trouble. OK?\u201d\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has caused global outrage and strained relations between Riyadh and Washington.
