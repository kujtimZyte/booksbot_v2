I mean, fast food chains!  (Pixabay)\n](/radionational/programs/greatmomentsinscience/fast-food/10617094)\n\nCompanies use a wide range of techniques pinched from neuroscience and\npsychology to get consumers into a shop, and to keep them coming back.\n\nFor fast food chains, part of the trick is inside the products their pushing.\n\n(This episode was first broadcast in September 2012)\n\n## Transcript\n\n**Dr Karl** : Fast food companies use their knowledge of neuroscience to\ninfluence you to eat unhealthy food, even when you're not hungry.\n\nThey use both the fact that sugar can be addictive as well as the fact that\nrepeated exposure can overcome your natural impulse control.\n\nAnd they never keep you waiting. After all, to set up an addiction you want\nthe time between the stimulus and the reward (or the time between walking into\nthe shop and scoffing the food) as short as possible.\n\nBut the fast food companies use a few more tricks nicked from the land of\nneuroscience.\n\nTheir fourth trick is that they sell stuff that is just overflowing with\nkilojoules. You see, thanks to a few million years of evolution, our natural\nimpulse is to eat as much as possible whenever food is available.\n\nBack in the old days, our restaurant was the open savannah \u2014 but it wasn't\nalways open. Back then, the energy-dense fats and sugars were prized as a\nbuffer (or protection) from starvation. They were also rare.\n\nBut in today's wealthy countries, food is always only a few minutes away \u2014 at\nthe most!\n\nThanks to our natural impulses, which used to be protective, we will eat until\nwe are full \u2014 and then keep on eating even more.\n\nUnfortunately, we just mentally recalibrate upwards the level at which we\nthink we are full.\n\nSure, to make themselves seem healthier, some fast food chains carry low-\nenergy items, like salads. But these make up a microscopic percentage of their\nsales.\n\nAnother trick that they use is to carry one or two items that are not too\nexpensive, and even the occasional 'loss-leader' item. A loss-leader is\nsomething that is deliberately sold at a loss.\n\nWhy would they do this? To lead you into the store and then sell you something\nmore expensive.\n\nYour brain does not like the act of losing money. In fact, imaging studies of\nthe brain show the same pattern of activity either when you stub your toe or\nwhen you lose money.\n\nLosing hurts! In fact, the pain of losing a small sum of money is greater than\nthe pleasure of winning exactly the same amount of money. Bargains are very\nattractive.\n\nSo, at your local fast-food outlet you might subconsciously realise that the\nfood is not a healthy choice. But you don't feel too bad because you think\nthat at least the meal is cheap.\n\nBut when you order the drink in the huge cup, you don't realise that you're\npaying a few dollars for something that costs them only a few cents. And\neverything else is expensive.\n\nSo the next time you feel tempted to buy some fast food because one single\nadvertised item or package seems cheap, remember this: In the vast majority of\ncases, it is more expensive to feed yourself with fast food than it is to buy\nthe ingredients and cook them yourself.\n\nThe sixth trick from the land of neuroscience goes all the way back to the\nNobel Prize-winning Russian scientist, Ivan Pavlov, and his slobbering dogs.\n\nJust before he fed his dogs, he rang a little bell. After some time of doing\nthis, he rang the little bell, but didn't offer them food.\n\nBut, once conditioned to the prospect of dinner time, his dogs still slobbered\nand salivated mightily. They had been conditioned to link salivation, food and\nthe little bell.\n\nIn the same way, the fast-food chains successfully condition you. They go out\nof their way to give you the exact same experience every time.\n\nThe inside of the shop is the same, the menu is the same, and employees in the\nsame uniform recite the same scripted greeting to you.\n\nThe last time this experience happened, you bought some fast food. So this\ntime, you'll probably buy some fast food again.\n\nThe seventh trick comes from research in neuroscience that tells us that the\npleasure in eating food does not come purely from the taste, smell and\nphysical act of eating.\n\nNo! A lot of the pleasure comes from past memories. One study gave children\nidentical chicken nuggets, but in different containers. The kids thought that\nthe food in the familiar Mac-packaging tasted better than the identical\nnuggets in plain packaging.\n\nSo fond memory can make grim reality seem better.\n\n## Credits\n\nPresenter\n\n    Dr Karl Kruszelnicki \nProducer\n\n    Carl Smith \n\n",
