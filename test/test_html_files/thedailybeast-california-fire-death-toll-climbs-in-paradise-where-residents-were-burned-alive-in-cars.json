In 1830, Aeneas Coffey, a Dublin exciseman, patented the first fully practical, fully efficient still based on that principle. A pair of tall, connected columns, one honeycombed with pipes to heat the wash and the other stacked with perforated plates where the wash trickled down through the steam, the still could be run continuously, rather than in batches, and was so efficient that it stripped off almost everything but the alcohol, yielding a spirit of great strength and purity.
