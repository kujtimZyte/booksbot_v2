The\nCanadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), an industry lobby group\nthat represents most of the country\u2019s oil and gas industry, declined to\ncomment about the estimates from the newly-released documents.\n\nThe current rules are so weak that companies can delay setting aside money to\ncover cleanup costs until they are out of business and can no longer afford to\npay anything, Wadsworth explained in his February presentation.\n\n\u201cEven though we have known these programs were flawed, there has been no\nproactive change to the liability programs,\u201d according to speaking notes\naccompanying the first presentation, delivered on Feb. 28 to the Calgary-based\nPetroleum History Society. \u201cUntil recently, the implications of our flawed\nsystem had not been realized.\u201d\n\n_National Observer_ obtained the documents from the February presentation and\nanother Wadsworth gave in June as part of a joint investigation with Global\nNews, the _Toronto Star_ and StarMetro Calgary for the Price of Oil series.\nThe documents were released after a request under freedom of information\nlegislation.\n\nWadsworth, who previously worked for nuclear power generator Bruce Power, had\na 28-year career in the military that included a stint as a colonel in\nAfghanistan and deployments to Cyprus, Angola, Mozambique and Bosnia, the AER\nsaid.

Most\nexperts contacted by the Price of Oil team said that this mining amount mostly\nrelated to liabilities in the oilsands, especially tailings ponds, with only a\nsmall fraction related to coal.\n\nOn its website, the regulator says the mining liability in Alberta is right\nnow calculated at about $28 billion, far less than what the regulator\u2019s\nliability vice president has estimated.\n\nThe estimated liability figures are based on the regulator\u2019s internal\nassessments, while the calculated liability that the public has been told\nabout is based on numbers reported by companies to the AER.\n\nOverall, the province has seen an increasing number of inactive wells becoming\n\u201corphans\u201d \u2014 wells at the end of their useful lives that need to be cleaned up\nbut no longer have owners who can pay for the job.\n\nIn recent years, the number of orphan wells designated for abandonment has\nclimbed from fewer than 800 to more than 2,000, according to industry data.\nThis number appears likely to continue climbing, according to Wadsworth\u2019s\npresentation. It could take nearly 300 years for the industry to abandon all\nof its wells, let alone clean them up, the document added.\n\nWadsworth\u2019s estimates are so high that several experts who reviewed the\npresentations have described the situation as an economic and environmental\ncrisis that raises questions about the financial health of a province that\nprides itself on strong fiscal management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Thomas Schneider, an accounting professor at Ryerson\nUniversity who has tracked liability management issues in the oilpatch for\nyears. \u201cI mean $260 billion is a lot of money\u2026 We\u2019re sitting on a huge\nliability, and then it\u2019s just a matter of who\u2019s going to end up having to pay\nfor it.\u201d\n\n![Amin Asadollahi, an environmental consultant who previously worked as a\nsenior policy advisor at Natural Resources Canada, said that the liability\nproblem needs attention now because the industry will face challenges as some\ncountries try to lessen their dependence on fossil\nfuels.](https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amin-asadollahi-\nformer-nrcan-sr-policy-advisory-courtesy-frank-boldt-global-\nnews.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=1200)\n\nAmin Asadollahi, an environmental consultant who previously worked as a senior\npolicy advisor at Natural Resources Canada, said that the liability problem\nneeds attention now because the industry will face challenges as some\ncountries try to lessen their dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nAlex T\u00e9treault/National Observer\n\n\u201cThese are mind-blowing numbers,\u201d said Amin Asadollahi, an environmental\nconsultant who previously worked as a senior policy advisor at Natural\nResources Canada. He added that the liability problem needs attention now\nbecause the industry will face challenges as some countries try to lessen\ntheir dependence on fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cI have never come across anything like this before, where the known risk\nestimated by decision makers is so much larger than the publicly available\nestimates,\u201d said economist Robyn Allan, a former president and chief executive\nofficer of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia who reviewed the\npresentations.\n\nThe numbers come at an awkward time for industry and government officials, who\nare trying to make the case that they are developing natural resources\nresponsibly and need new pipeline projects such as the Alberta-B.C. Trans\nMountain expansion to further expand.\n\nAlberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips also characterized Wadsworth\u2019s\nestimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down\novernight.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that there are certainly liabilities with orphan wells, with\ntailings ponds and with other activities on the landscape, but our government\nfrom day one has taken these matters seriously and we\u2019ve actually seen pretty\ngood progress on this,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question there\u2019s more to\ndo, but we\u2019ve taken it very seriously from the beginning.\u201d\n\nPhillips added that Alberta, ruled by Progressive Conservative governments for\n44 years before the New Democratic Party was elected in 2015, had previously\nfailed to take this issue seriously, but that her government was considering\nwhether to force industry to set aside more money as a security deposit.\n\n![Alberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips characterized Wadsworth\u2019s\nestimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down\novernight.](https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ab-min-of-\nenviro-shannon-philips-courtesy-dave-carels2fglobal-\nnews.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=1200)\n\nAlberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips characterized Wadsworth\u2019s\nestimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down\novernight.\n\nDave Carels/Global News\n\n\u201cWe certainly can \u2014 that is one of the tools in our toolbox as we review the\nMine Financial Security Program (MFSP) and other industry association levies\nthat have to do with (orphan wells.)

Are we going to deal with\nit now? Are we going to deal with it in 50 years or 100 years? What kind of\nlegacy is going to be left?\u201d\n\nIn the presentations, Wadsworth warned that tougher regulations would be\nneeded to prevent the problem from getting worse while ensuring that \u201cwe don\u2019t\ntrip economic growth\u201d for a sector that is an important engine in Canada\u2019s\neconomy.\n\nThe liabilities are broken down into three categories. After the $130 billion\nestimated mining liability, the next largest category is the $100 billion cost\nof cleaning up conventional oil and gas wells. The third group of liabilities,\nprovincially regulated pipelines, came in at about $30 billion, according to\nWadsworth\u2019s February presentation.\n\nPhillips, the environment minister, said the solution involves partners at\nother levels of government, including municipalities, First Nations and the\nfederal government.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of liability questions that remain unanswered because this\nis a long-term problem, and we did not see leadership from the previous\ngovernment for 44 years,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that there is more work to be done.\u201d\n\n",

His presentation underscored the importance of being transparent with\nthe public about the sector\u2019s liabilities.\n\u201cDespite our best efforts, there are liabilities that are no longer owned by a\ncompany, or are not addressed by existing liability programs,\u201d Wadsworth\u2019s\nFebruary presentation said.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that the costs of these liabilities is retained by industry\nand not passed on to Albertans.\u201d\n\n\nNearly half of the total estimated liability \u2014 $130 billion \u2014 is what the AER\nputs in the \u201cmining\u201d category and involves oilsands and coal mines. Most\nexperts contacted by the Price of Oil team said that this mining amount mostly\nrelated to liabilities in the oilsands, especially tailings ponds, with only a\nsmall fraction related to coal.\nOn its website, the regulator says the mining liability in Alberta is right\nnow calculated at about $28 billion, far less than what the regulator\u2019s\nliability vice president has estimated.\nThe estimated liability figures are based on the regulator\u2019s internal\nassessments, while the calculated liability that the public has been told\nabout is based on numbers reported by companies to the AER.\nOverall, the province has seen an increasing number of inactive wells becoming\n\u201corphans\u201d \u2014 wells at the end of their useful lives that need to be cleaned up\nbut no longer have owners who can pay for the job.\nIn recent years, the number of orphan wells designated for abandonment has\nclimbed from fewer than 800 to more than 2,000, according to industry data.\nThis number appears likely to continue climbing, according to Wadsworth\u2019s\npresentation. It could take nearly 300 years for the industry to abandon all\nof its wells, let alone clean them up, the document added.\nWadsworth\u2019s estimates are so high that several experts who reviewed the\npresentations have described the situation as an economic and environmental\ncrisis that raises questions about the financial health of a province that\nprides itself on strong fiscal management.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Thomas Schneider, an accounting professor at Ryerson\nUniversity who has tracked liability management issues in the oilpatch for\nyears. \u201cI mean $260 billion is a lot of money\u2026 We\u2019re sitting on a huge\nliability, and then it\u2019s just a matter of who\u2019s going to end up having to pay\nfor it.\u201d\n\nAmin Asadollahi, an environmental consultant who previously worked as a senior\npolicy advisor at Natural Resources Canada, said that the liability problem\nneeds attention now because the industry will face challenges as some\ncountries try to lessen their dependence on fossil fuels.\nAlex T\u00e9treault/National Observer\n\u201cThese are mind-blowing numbers,\u201d said Amin Asadollahi, an environmental\nconsultant who previously worked as a senior policy advisor at Natural\nResources Canada. He added that the liability problem needs attention now\nbecause the industry will face challenges as some countries try to lessen\ntheir dependence on fossil fuels.\n\u201cI have never come across anything like this before, where the known risk\nestimated by decision makers is so much larger than the publicly available\nestimates,\u201d said economist Robyn Allan, a former president and chief executive\nofficer of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia who reviewed the\npresentations.\nThe numbers come at an awkward time for industry and government officials, who\nare trying to make the case that they are developing natural resources\nresponsibly and need new pipeline projects such as the Alberta-B.C. Trans\nMountain expansion to further expand.\nAlberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips also characterized Wadsworth\u2019s\nestimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down\novernight.\n\u201cThe fact is that there are certainly liabilities with orphan wells, with\ntailings ponds and with other activities on the landscape, but our government\nfrom day one has taken these matters seriously and we\u2019ve actually seen pretty\ngood progress on this,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question there\u2019s more to\ndo, but we\u2019ve taken it very seriously from the beginning.\u201d\nPhillips added that Alberta, ruled by Progressive Conservative governments for\n44 years before the New Democratic Party was elected in 2015, had previously\nfailed to take this issue seriously, but that her government was considering\nwhether to force industry to set aside more money as a security deposit.\n\nAlberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips characterized Wadsworth\u2019s\nestimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down\novernight.\nDave Carels/Global News\n\u201cWe certainly can \u2014 that is one of the tools in our toolbox as we review the\nMine Financial Security Program (MFSP) and other industry association levies\nthat have to do with (orphan wells.) There is no question that this is an\nongoing conversation.\u201d\nSchneider, the accounting professor, said the liabilities have the potential\nto affect Alberta\u2019s balance sheet and its credit rating.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way industry could fund that right now,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of when are we going to deal with it. Are we going to deal with\nit now? Are we going to deal with it in 50 years or 100 years? What kind of\nlegacy is going to be left?\u201d\nIn the presentations, Wadsworth warned that tougher regulations would be\nneeded to prevent the problem from getting worse while ensuring that \u201cwe don\u2019t\ntrip economic growth\u201d for a sector that is an important engine in Canada\u2019s\neconomy.\nThe liabilities are broken down into three categories. After the $130 billion\nestimated mining liability, the next largest category is the $100 billion cost\nof cleaning up conventional oil and gas wells. The third group of liabilities,\nprovincially regulated pipelines, came in at about $30 billion, according to\nWadsworth\u2019s February presentation.\nPhillips, the environment minister, said the solution involves partners at\nother levels of government, including municipalities, First Nations and the\nfederal government.\n\u201cWe have a number of liability questions that remain unanswered because this\nis a long-term problem, and we did not see leadership from the previous\ngovernment for 44 years,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that there is more work to be done.\u201d"
