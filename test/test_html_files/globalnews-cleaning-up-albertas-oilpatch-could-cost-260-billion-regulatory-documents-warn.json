Most experts contacted by the Price of Oil team said that this mining amount mostly related to liabilities in the oilsands, especially tailings ponds, with only a small fraction related to coal.\n\nOn its website, the regulator says the mining liability in Alberta is right now calculated at about $28 billion, far less than what the regulator\u2019s liability vice president has estimated.\n\nThe estimated liability figures are based on the regulator\u2019s internal assessments, while the calculated liability that the public has been told about is based on numbers reported by companies to the AER.\n\nOverall, the province has seen an increasing number of inactive wells becoming \u201corphans\u201d \u2014 wells at the end of their useful lives that need to be cleaned up but no longer have owners who can pay for the job.\n\nIn recent years, the number of orphan wells designated for abandonment has climbed from fewer than 800 to more than 2,000, according to industry data. This number appears likely to continue climbing, according to Wadsworth\u2019s presentation. It could take nearly 300 years for the industry to abandon all of its wells, let alone clean them up, the document added.\n\nWadsworth\u2019s estimates are so high that several experts who reviewed the presentations have described the situation as an economic and environmental crisis that raises questions about the financial health of a province that prides itself on strong fiscal management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Thomas Schneider, an accounting professor at Ryerson University who has tracked liability management issues in the oilpatch for years. \u201cI mean $260 billion is a lot of money\u2026 We\u2019re sitting on a huge liability, and then it\u2019s just a matter of who\u2019s going to end up having to pay for it.\u201d\n\n![Amin Asadollahi, an environmental consultant who previously worked as a senior policy advisor at Natural Resources Canada, said that the liability problem needs attention now because the industry will face challenges as some countries try to lessen their dependence on fossil fuels.](https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amin-asadollahi-former-nrcan-sr-policy-advisory-courtesy-frank-boldt-global-news.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=1200)\n\nAmin Asadollahi, an environmental consultant who previously worked as a senior policy advisor at Natural Resources Canada, said that the liability problem needs attention now because the industry will face challenges as some countries try to lessen their dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nAlex T\u00e9treault/National Observer\n\n\u201cThese are mind-blowing numbers,\u201d said Amin Asadollahi, an environmental consultant who previously worked as a senior policy advisor at Natural Resources Canada. He added that the liability problem needs attention now because the industry will face challenges as some countries try to lessen their dependence on fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cI have never come across anything like this before, where the known risk estimated by decision makers is so much larger than the publicly available estimates,\u201d said economist Robyn Allan, a former president and chief executive officer of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia who reviewed the presentations.\n\nThe numbers come at an awkward time for industry and government officials, who are trying to make the case that they are developing natural resources responsibly and need new pipeline projects such as the Alberta-B.C. Trans Mountain expansion to further expand.\n\nAlberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips also characterized Wadsworth\u2019s estimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down overnight.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that there are certainly liabilities with orphan wells, with tailings ponds and with other activities on the landscape, but our government from day one has taken these matters seriously and we\u2019ve actually seen pretty good progress on this,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question there\u2019s more to do, but we\u2019ve taken it very seriously from the beginning.\u201d\n\nPhillips added that Alberta, ruled by Progressive Conservative governments for 44 years before the New Democratic Party was elected in 2015, had previously failed to take this issue seriously, but that her government was considering whether to force industry to set aside more money as a security deposit.\n\n![Alberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips characterized Wadsworth\u2019s estimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down overnight.](https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ab-min-of-enviro-shannon-philips-courtesy-dave-carels2fglobal-news.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=1200)\n\nAlberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips characterized Wadsworth\u2019s estimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down overnight.\n\nDave Carels/Global News\n\n\u201cWe certainly can \u2014 that is one of the tools in our toolbox as we review the Mine Financial Security Program (MFSP) and other industry association levies that have to do with (orphan wells.) There is no question that this is an ongoing conversation.\u201d\n\nSchneider, the accounting professor, said the liabilities have the potential to affect Alberta\u2019s balance sheet and its credit rating.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way industry could fund that right now,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of when are we going to deal with it. Are we going to deal with it now? Are we going to deal with it in 50 years or 100 years? What kind of legacy is going to be left?\u201d\n\nIn the presentations, Wadsworth warned that tougher regulations would be needed to prevent the problem from getting worse while ensuring that \u201cwe don\u2019t trip economic growth\u201d for a sector that is an important engine in Canada\u2019s economy.\n\nThe liabilities are broken down into three categories. After the $130 billion estimated mining liability, the next largest category is the $100 billion cost of cleaning up conventional oil and gas wells. The third group of liabilities, provincially regulated pipelines, came in at about $30 billion, according to Wadsworth\u2019s February presentation.\n\nPhillips, the environment minister, said the solution involves partners at other levels of government, including municipalities, First Nations and the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of liability questions that remain unanswered because this is a long-term problem, and we did not see leadership from the previous government for 44 years,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that there is more work to be done.\u201d\n",

It could take nearly 300 years for the industry to abandon all of its wells, let alone clean them up, the document added.\nWadsworth\u2019s estimates are so high that several experts who reviewed the presentations have described the situation as an economic and environmental crisis that raises questions about the financial health of a province that prides itself on strong fiscal management.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Thomas Schneider, an accounting professor at Ryerson University who has tracked liability management issues in the oilpatch for years. \u201cI mean $260 billion is a lot of money\u2026 We\u2019re sitting on a huge liability, and then it\u2019s just a matter of who\u2019s going to end up having to pay for it.\u201d\n\nAmin Asadollahi, an environmental consultant who previously worked as a senior policy advisor at Natural Resources Canada, said that the liability problem needs attention now because the industry will face challenges as some countries try to lessen their dependence on fossil fuels.\nAlex T\u00e9treault/National Observer\n\u201cThese are mind-blowing numbers,\u201d said Amin Asadollahi, an environmental consultant who previously worked as a senior policy advisor at Natural Resources Canada. He added that the liability problem needs attention now because the industry will face challenges as some countries try to lessen their dependence on fossil fuels.\n\u201cI have never come across anything like this before, where the known risk estimated by decision makers is so much larger than the publicly available estimates,\u201d said economist Robyn Allan, a former president and chief executive officer of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia who reviewed the presentations.\nThe numbers come at an awkward time for industry and government officials, who are trying to make the case that they are developing natural resources responsibly and need new pipeline projects such as the Alberta-B.C. Trans Mountain expansion to further expand.\nAlberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips also characterized Wadsworth\u2019s estimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down overnight.\n\u201cThe fact is that there are certainly liabilities with orphan wells, with tailings ponds and with other activities on the landscape, but our government from day one has taken these matters seriously and we\u2019ve actually seen pretty good progress on this,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question there\u2019s more to do, but we\u2019ve taken it very seriously from the beginning.\u201d\nPhillips added that Alberta, ruled by Progressive Conservative governments for 44 years before the New Democratic Party was elected in 2015, had previously failed to take this issue seriously, but that her government was considering whether to force industry to set aside more money as a security deposit.\n\nAlberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips characterized Wadsworth\u2019s estimates as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which the industry shuts down overnight.\nDave Carels/Global News\n\u201cWe certainly can \u2014 that is one of the tools in our toolbox as we review the Mine Financial Security Program (MFSP) and other industry association levies that have to do with (orphan wells.) There is no question that this is an ongoing conversation.\u201d\nSchneider, the accounting professor, said the liabilities have the potential to affect Alberta\u2019s balance sheet and its credit rating.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way industry could fund that right now,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of when are we going to deal with it. Are we going to deal with it now? Are we going to deal with it in 50 years or 100 years? What kind of legacy is going to be left?\u201d\nIn the presentations, Wadsworth warned that tougher regulations would be needed to prevent the problem from getting worse while ensuring that \u201cwe don\u2019t trip economic growth\u201d for a sector that is an important engine in Canada\u2019s economy.\nThe liabilities are broken down into three categories. After the $130 billion estimated mining liability, the next largest category is the $100 billion cost of cleaning up conventional oil and gas wells. The third group of liabilities, provincially regulated pipelines, came in at about $30 billion, according to Wadsworth\u2019s February presentation.\nPhillips, the environment minister, said the solution involves partners at other levels of government, including municipalities, First Nations and the federal government.\n\u201cWe have a number of liability questions that remain unanswered because this is a long-term problem, and we did not see leadership from the previous government for 44 years,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that there is more work to be done.\u201d"
