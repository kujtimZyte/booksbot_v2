return to the Hockeyroos, but for now, farming is in her blood and\nMs Slattery is relishing the change in pace and time spent with her family.\n\n## Back to Bundeera\n\nMs Slattery grew up on a farm in the tiny town of South Stirling, at the base\nof the picturesque Stirling Ranges in southern WA.\n\nDespite the isolation, Ms Slattery and her siblings relished their rural\nchildhood.\n\n\"Growing up here was amazing,\" she said.\n\n\"We caused a bit of a ruckus for mum and dad, but we were able to experience\nsome very unique things and see the world in a different way.\n\n\"It's given me a lot of skills moving forward.\"\n\nMs Slattery attended a primary school with just 32 other students and first\npicked up a hockey stick by accident when asked to fill in for her brother's\nteam.\n\n\"It was a weird way to come into the sport but I love the skill and I love the\nspeed of the game,\" she said.\n\n\"I really loved being part of a team, so they were a few key factors for me to\ncontinue playing.\n\n\"I realised I was reasonably handy at it and by the time I was about 13 or 14,\nI really started to focus on hockey.\"\n\nMs Slattery made the choice to leave the rural lifestyle behind, moving to\nPerth to chase her dream at 15.\n\nShe made her senior international debut for the Hockeyroos in 2014 and\ncompeted in every major international tournament in the two-year lead-up to\nthe 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.\n\nA decade after first moving away and the 25-year-old is back home on the\nfamily farm, Bundeera, ready to start a new chapter.\n\n![Kathryn

experienced success and failure during her Hockeyroos career.\n\nShe played at the World Cup in 2018 but missed out on selection to the\nCommonwealth Games.\n\n\"The highs and lows, from a personal point of view, have been fantastic,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"The lows have been difficult, but I enjoy them in the sense that you can get\nsomething out of it.\n\n\"You learn a lot of things about being an athlete, what it takes, and also how\nhard you can push yourself.\"\n\nMs Slattery said she views her Olympic debut as the pinnacle of her hockey\ncareer.\n\nThe Australian women's team finished in sixth place, with Slattery scoring\ntwice in her team's quarter final loss to New Zealand.\n\n\"For me that was something I worked so hard for, really put everything on the\nline for,\" she said.\n\n\"To be able to run out on the pitch that first time and become an Olympian was\na fantastic feeling.\n\n\"My parents and family were in the crowd and to have their backing was\ndefinitely

a change\n\nAs instability crept into the organisation, Ms Slattery began to feel\nfrustrated with Hockey Australia and found it difficult to stay motivated.\n\nCoaches walked away and the dynamic of the group changed.\n\n\"I felt that I wasn't getting the satisfaction out of the environment that I\nhad previously,\" she said.\n\n\"To stay motivated is definitely difficult for any high-performance athlete\nbut when you're facing some uncertainty, it makes it more difficult every day\nto get up and get what you want out of the program.\n\n\"There have been a number of people within the group that had similar\nfeelings.\"\n\nMs Slattery, feeling confident in her achievements and performances at the\nhighest level, chose to take an indefinite break.\n\n\"At this point I'm unsure exactly where I want to head with hockey,\" she said.\n\n\"I really love the sport but there are other things I really want to pursue\nfor a period of time.\n\n\"I'd like to travel and potentially play overseas.\n\n\"I might find that I really miss it \u2026 I left the door open for a purpose and\nhad good conversations about the potential to come back.\"\n\n![Woman dressed in hockey uniform stands
