I hate running. I like lifting, I guess, but I never seem to\ndo it enough, and if your form is not that of Adonis, you will reliably have\nsomeone at the gym shamble over and tell you to hinge your hips or something.\nI can\u2019t ride a bike due to never really being able to learn thanks to my\ndyspraxia, [the thing that Daniel Radcliffe\nhas](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=5605093&page=1), and also the fact\nI didn\u2019t want to.\n\nExercise to me has always seemed like a foreign language or a musical\ninstrument\u2014something other people had learned to do, that I had tried, failed\nat, and decided was not part of my life. I\u2019ve also had weight issues my entire\nlife. I\u2019ve been 300lbs, I\u2019ve been 130lbs, I think about my weight at least 50\ntimes a day. I tell myself I\u2019m fat, I\u2019m ugly, I\u2019m bloated, I look horrific, a\nmillion weird insults in an obsessive circle that I\u2019m never quite fully\ndistracted from.\n\nIt\u2019s the same obsessiveness that got me into video games\u2014quick, progressive\nachievement, things I can point at and say \u201chey, I did that.\u201d It was a place\nwhere I could achieve things that weren\u2019t connected to how I physically\npresented myself or moved in the world.\n\nAnd somehow, an expensive bike with a computer attached to it has meshed with\nmy obsessive gaming habits. The incremental jumps in power, the calories\nburned\u2014all of it ties into that same weird place in my brain that says \u201cthis\nis good, I will do a lot of it,\u201d to the point that I bike so much my legs are\ngiant, sore tree trunks and my ass hurts. Maybe I\u2019m taking a different\nperspective to most riders, but this is a game with numbers I can improve and\nmy body happens to be along for the ride.\n\nAt its heart, Peloton is a numerical fitness game, where I am constantly\nplaying to make a number go up\n\nPeloton, a gaming-meets-spin class \u201cconnected fitness\u201d device, is something\nI\u2019ve been vaguely aware of since it launched in 2014. It\u2019s a stationary spin\nbike (different from a regular bike in your position with regards to the\nhandles, [as well as a few other things](https://ask.metafilter.com/81620\n/What-is-the-practical-difference-between-a-spinning-and-regular-stationary-\nexercise-bike)) with a 22 inch, 1080p customized android tablet that streams\nclasses either live or on demand. The classes range from 15 to 60 minutes,\nfrom low impact to brutal High Intensity Interval Training sessions, with\nmusic from the worst of the top 40 to weird 90s rock. You attach a heart-rate\nmonitor around your sternum (way less weird than it sounds), clip your feet in\n(so you can ride hard without your feet flying off), choose a class, and ride.\nYour pedal speed (cadence) meshes with your resistance (adjusted by a knob at\narm\u2019s reach) to make output, which is your power at any given moment measured\nin watts.\n\nI got into Peloton after talking to a friend who's been cycling a ton, and was\nthe only person I\u2019d ever talked to about fitness who didn\u2019t say either A) you\nshould run, it\u2019s great, B) it\u2019s all diet or C) have you tried lifting? His\noutlook was simple\u2014give cycling a go, spin class is fun, and if you can\u2019t ride\na bike, maybe try one of those classes. My immediate response was obvious\u2014I\nhate leaving the house and the gym sucks. He suggested Peloton \u201cas it has a\nshit ton of numbers,\u201d which I love.\n\nI also should add that in my sorry, worthless existence I\u2019ve purchased a\nbowflex, as well as those adjustable weights and resistance bands. I tried\nwatching YouTube classes to do stuff, and I stuck with each of these things\nfor about three days at most. Peloton is a $2,000 investment\u2014a gaming laptop\u2019s\nworth\u2014but I was comfortable with selling it on Craigslist to someone else to\nmitigate the loss if it was a total failure.\n\nI\u2019m also intimately aware of my own shit\u2014my compulsiveness, disorganization,\nand laziness. If I want to do anything it has to be in the same place, in the\nsame area, in the same way, every time. It has to be an easy choice, one I can\nmake almost without thinking. Anything repetitive that\u2019s not easy to get to\nand activate will inevitably fall off. So I got the bike installed directly\nnext to my desk for when I work from home, visible from my desk.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about Peloton is that, though it _stinks_ of gamification\n\u2014leaderboards, achievements, \u201cscores\u201d in the form of the total kilojoule\noutput on a ride\u2014it\u2019s never seemed to be marketed as a device for gamers. .\nCommercials [show attractive, sweaty\npeople](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpciRANyCKc) \u201cgiving it their all,\u201d\n\u201c[being better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpw5vcjWd3c)\u201d at life. Would\nany of these people even KNOW that Aeris was called Aerith in _Final Fantasy\nVII_ \u2019s japanese release? _Would they even care?_\n\nPeloton has a lot of what I like about video games. It has very clear\nprogression\u2014like _Spider-Man_ and _Dead Cells\u2014_ and I really enjoy the act of\nplaying it, even though it's repetitive. I love _Destiny 2_ , for example,\nwhich is a big piece of shit story-wise but is mechanically superb. If there\u2019s\na numerical evaluation of my growth (experience, power) and/or a series of\nthings I can achieve in a list (like all the backpacks in _Spider-Man_ ), I\u2019ll\nstick with a game. But one _big_ consistency with everything I play is that 10\nminutes can feel rewarding\u2014you do something, you get somewhere, you progress.\n\nAt its heart, Peloton is a numerical fitness game, where I am constantly\nplaying to make a number go up, so that I can get a big number on average at\nthe end. The more I burn, the more I progress, the better I feel.\n\nThe instructors also lack a level of the condescension I\u2019ve associated with\nall exercise\u2014some are a little woo woo life coachy for me, but most of them\nare encouraging and technical, and clearly have a remit to _not_ suggest any\nrange of resistance or output is wrong, per se. You get on, you work, you\nsweat a shit ton and you smell like a big ass, and you are done. You follow\nnumbers to produce numbers, you move your body to get there sure, but the\nnumbers are your life.\n\n![1541182864693-V5Rf65wF](https://video-\nimages.vice.com/_uncategorized/1541182864693-V5Rf65wF.jpeg?resize=320:*)\n\nImage: Ed Zitron\n\nEvery bit of information I have from my ride is on\n[Strava](https://www.strava.com/), a social network for fitness [best known\nfor leaky data](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-\ntracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases). I stare at it,\nobsess (unhealthily) over how much I\u2019ve burned, how strong I am over 20\nminutes, or 30 minutes, or 45 minutes, and how I might be able to get\nstronger. Every Peloton class is a map to spawn into with a difficulty score\nand music that I\u2019ll be made to work to. If I just have fun and follow along,\nthat\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll still burn. If I want to push myself to do more, I can do\nthat too. The guarantee of actual progression is addictive. I don\u2019t have to\nworry that if I\u2019m feeling tired and shitty for 30 minutes because those 30\nminutes will even in a low impact, relaxed session burn 300-400 calories. In\n30 days I\u2019ve clocked 53 rides, gone 382 miles, burning 18,614 calories,\nspending over 20 hours on the bike. Compare this to when I forced myself to do\nmaybe 20 hours in the gym in the space of a year.\n\nIf Peloton ever adds an experience and gear system, that may truly break me.\n\nThere are some good and bad parts to the whole \u201cI treat a bike like I do when\nI\u2019m addicted to a video game.\u201d The good is obvious: I\u2019m slimmer, stronger,\nhealthier, I don\u2019t have to really think or plan much for exercise to be part\nof my life as it\u2019s essentially always there, always available. I\u2019ve used raw\nnumbers to somewhat keep down my own weight-based self-loathing, and I find\nmyself happier, less plagued by my own neurotic nightmares. Where games have\nmanaged to push a particular internal button to make me feel better, perhaps\nPeloton has managed to make me either ignore the physical or just know it\u2019s\nthere, part of the game and that the mechanics are, indeed, not just on the\nscreen.\n\nThe bad part is that my body both yearns and aches as part of the process. I\nam on the bike almost every day, I am piling on work and I hesitate to take\nrest days ever as I\u2019m dedicated to the streak achievements (for days in a row\nand weeks in a row) and not feeling like a lazy asshole. If I don\u2019t ride, I\nfeel bad. I override without rest, and I\u2019ll find myself almost forcing myself\nto take a day\u2014which feels good, until I think that as a result of my inaction\nI won\u2019t ever get back into it. I get the anxiety that I\u2019m not getting stronger\nenough, that in comparison to friends on the bike I\u2019m not strong enough, that\nmaybe I\u2019m not progressing fast enough, looking up strategies from cyclists to\nget stronger, getting pissed off when I see [people may\ncheat](https://www.reddit.com/r/pelotoncycle/comments/88ansc/done_with_leaderboard/)\nand wondering if anyone who does better than me has messed with their\ncalibration. There\u2019re exploiters in every game, right?\n\nIf Peloton ever adds an experience and gear system, that may truly break me. I\nalready grind\u2014I did an hour and 45 minutes of exercise one day this week for a\ntotal of over 1700 calories. It\u2019ll destroy me.\n\nIf there\u2019s one major flaw in their marketing, and honestly, in all fitness\nmarketing, it\u2019s the focus on the aspirational, the lean physique and the\nrippling abs. If there\u2019s one thing that will get me to stop, it\u2019s if the\nnumbers begin to stay the same, and I plateau. I have no idea. But for now, I\n[will never log\noff](https://twitter.com/dril/status/247222360309121024?lang=en), no matter\nhow many people say I look dumb in cycling shorts.\n\n![](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png)\n\n",

If I don\u2019t ride, I\nfeel bad. I override without rest, and I\u2019ll find myself almost forcing myself\nto take a day\u2014which feels good, until I think that as a result of my inaction\nI won\u2019t ever get back into it. I get the anxiety that I\u2019m not getting stronger\nenough, that in comparison to friends on the bike I\u2019m not strong enough, that\nmaybe I\u2019m not progressing fast enough, looking up strategies from cyclists to\nget stronger, getting pissed off when I see people may\ncheat\nand wondering if anyone who does better than me has messed with their\ncalibration. There\u2019re exploiters in every game, right?\nIf Peloton ever adds an experience and gear system, that may truly break me. I\nalready grind\u2014I did an hour and 45 minutes of exercise one day this week for a\ntotal of over 1700 calories. It\u2019ll destroy me.\nIf there\u2019s one major flaw in their marketing, and honestly, in all fitness\nmarketing, it\u2019s the focus on the aspirational, the lean physique and the\nrippling abs. If there\u2019s one thing that will get me to stop, it\u2019s if the\nnumbers begin to stay the same, and I plateau. I have no idea. But for now, I\nwill never log\noff, no matter\nhow many people say I look dumb in cycling shorts.\n"
