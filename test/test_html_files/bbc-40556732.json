bonfire at Inverary playing fields is one of four sites affected\nby a High Court injunction banning any more material being added to the pile\n\nTwo unionist parties have accused Sinn F\u00e9in of trying to discredit and demean\nTwelfth of July commemorations, including bonfires and parades.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Progressive\nUnionist Party (PUP) alleged Sinn F\u00e9in is waging an aggressive \"cultural war\".\n\nThey called on unionists to attend a \"cultural convention\" in the autumn to\npromote future Twelfth of July events.\n\nThe statement was issued by DUP and PUP group leaders on Belfast City Council.\n\nBonfires are traditionally lit in loyalist areas of Northern Ireland on the\neve of the annual 12 July celebrations.\n\nThe tradition commemorates the [victory of William III - also known as William\nof Orange or King Billy - over the Catholic forces of James II at the Battle\nof the Boyne in\n1690](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/battle_of_the_boyne).\n\nHowever, some bonfires have been controversial, as they have presented a risk\nto health and safety or caused damage to homes and property.\n\nThe four bonfire sites named in the injunction are:\n\n  * Ravenscroft Avenue car park/Bloomfield walkway\n  * Avoniel Leisure Centre car park\n  * Inverary playing fields\n  * Cregagh Park East\n\n## 'Public safety'\n\nThe DUP-PUP statement was released days after [the council was granted a High\nCourt injunction](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-40533984) that\nbans any more material being added to four east Belfast bonfires.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in has told the BBC that all political parties on the council,\nincluding the unionist parties, had supported filing for the injunction.\n\nA Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson said: \"It is clear from this statement that both the\nDUP and PUP have provided no answer to the public for their support for the\ncourt injunction on four council sites.\n\n\"What is needed now is leadership from unionist parties instead of attempting\nto divert from their support for these injunctions with a baseless and\ninflammatory attack on Sinn F\u00e9in.\n\n\"This injunction was supported by all political parties on Belfast City\nCouncil including the DUP, UUP and PUP.\"\n\n## 'They haven't a spine'\n\nAlliance Party Leader Naomi Long has said the move was proposed by council\nstaff and had the support of unionist councillors.\n\nPointing out that the joint PUP-DUP letter did not defend nor deny that\nsupport, she tweeted: \"They hope by keeping quiet they can off-load\nresponsibility onto Alliance for taking [a] decision.\n\n\"They haven't a spine between them, frankly.\"\n\nShe also said that the \"vast majority of residents would be grateful for\nleadership to break climate of fear\" but added that \"locals [are] afraid to\nspeak\" as the fear a \"backlash\".\n\nOn Monday, a council spokesperson said the injunction was \"obtained in the\ncontext of preserving public safety and avoiding and minimising damage to\nproperty\".\n\n\"In particular its purpose was to prevent more materials from reaching the\nsites in question.\"\n\nThe council added that the injunction \"does not make any specific reference to\nthe lighting of the bonfire\".\n\nIn relation to the assertion that the injunction had the support of all\nparties, a council spokesperson said: \"A meeting was conducted with the caveat\nof confidentiality due to the sensitive nature of the issues to be discussed,\nand the presence of external agencies.\"\n\n## 'Clarification' welcomed\n\nIn later statement, the PUP welcomed what it described as \"clarification\" from\nBelfast City Council.\n\nIt said: \"We believe that this clarification clearly defines the original\nintention of preventing the bonfires from growing to an unmanageable size that\nmay endanger property, and, in some cases, life.\n\n\"We also believe that it does not prevent the lighting of any materials that\nare already on site and that no person doing so should face any legal action.\n\n\"This injunction should not be allowed to be used as a blanket authorisation\nto criminalise our community.\n\n\"Where this happens, we will be there to oppose and stand strong against any\nstreet agitation from Republicans,\" it added.\n\n## 'Cultural dictation'\n\nIn their joint statement, DUP councillor Lee Reynolds and PUP councillor Billy\nHutchinson said parades and bonfires were about \"celebrating a momentous\nvictory and a key part of the narrative around our contribution to our\nnational history\".\n\n\"In recent weeks there has been a clear strategy to rewrite this narrative and\nto discredit the celebrations surrounding it,\" they added.\n\n\"Republicans wish to undo all positive progress such as the growth of\nOrangefest and the successes of the Bonfire programme.\n\n\"We must not let our unity of purpose be disrupted or harmed by the actions of\nthose who want to devalue and demean us.\"\n\nLast month, a council-owned car park at Ravenscroft Avenue was closed off by\nyoung men building a bonfire on the site\n\nSinn F\u00e9in councillor Jim McVeigh was among those who welcomed the injunction,\nsaying it would stop large bonfires threatening the safety of people, homes\nand property.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Nolan Show on Monday, Mr McVeigh said he hoped the\ncouncil would ask a contractor to clear all the material already gathered at\nthe four bonfire sites.\n\nHowever, the DUP and PUP statement claimed Mr McVeigh was being used as a\n\"glorified message boy\" to hide Sinn F\u00e9in's \"strategic failures\".\n\nThey accused Sinn F\u00e9in of an \"attempt at cultural dictation\" and called on\nunionists to \"work together for a cultural renewal that includes input from\nthe parading organisations, bands, community organisations and bonfire\ngroups\".\n\n## 'One voice'\n\nThe DUP and PUP issued an invitation to \"those who want the Twelfth\ncelebrations to succeed to come together this autumn for a cultural\nconvention\".\n\n\"The aim of this will be to ensure that the unionist community can go forward\nwith one voice in promoting our culture, heritage and tradition, as well as to\nensure that our celebrations continue to be bigger, better and more successful\nthan ever before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Belfast City Council has said the decision-making process which led\nto the bonfire injunction will remain confidential.\n\nSo far, it is not clear if any steps to stop bonfire-building at any of the\nfour site have been taken.\n\nThe council said it will \"review any information received - either directly or\nvia the police - relating to any persons allegedly breaching the injunction,\nand will consider what further action is appropriate\".\n\n",
