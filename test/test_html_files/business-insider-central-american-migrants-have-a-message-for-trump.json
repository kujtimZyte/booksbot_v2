Both propositions are\nlegally dubious. Trump also said he had told the [U.S. military\nmobilizing](https://apnews.com/d5889a081f2a4c548d7bc789a4487b20) at the\nsouthwest border that if U.S. troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should\nreact as though the rocks were \"rifles.\"\n\n\"It is pure ignorance for him to think like that,\" said Marta Cuellos, a 40\n-year-old from Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. \"A rock is not the same as a\nrifle.\"\n\nWhile some migrants have clashed with Mexican police at a bridge on the\nGuatemala border, most of those traveling with the caravans have been peaceful\nand say they are fleeing violence and poverty at home. Those traveling through\nthe southern state of Oaxaca on Friday said they are not looking for trouble.\n\nCuellos said she owned a cantina back home in Honduras but left because she\ncould no longer make rent and was being harassed by police. She persuaded her\n35-year-old sister to join her on the trip, and said the only thing they want\nis work and a better life in the United States. It's her second attempt. She\nfirst crossed into the U.S. seven years ago but was deported last year.\n\nRepublican Jeff Flake grabs Trump by the collar over his claim that 'fake\nnews' is behind political violence](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-\nflake-against-trump-migrant-caravan-violence-press-2018-11)_\n\nSelvin Maldonado, a 25-year-old from Copan, Honduras, said he left his wife\nand baby daughter at home in search of a better living to support his\nchildren. He took his 5-year-old son, Dennys, with him.\n\n\"What Trump said is stupid,\" Maldonado said while walking to the town of\nDonaji. \"I don't want to attack police, because my concern is my son.\"\n\nThe [migrants](https://apnews.com/14b55fb12cc843b58a82b28cb30f8eb8) also were\nalso turned off by the U.S. president's characterization of the slow-moving\ncaravan and the three smaller ones following as \"invasion.\" Trump has proposed\ndetaining migrants in massive tent cities at the border.\n\n\"We are not killers,\" said Stephany Lopez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran with the\nfirst caravan. \"We just want to work for a few years, and after that he can\ndeport us if he wants.\"\n\nLopez noted that the president's mother, who was born in Scotland, was an\nimmigrant.\n\n\"He should think of us as equals. Immigrants have built that country,\" she\nsaid.\n\nIn June, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that domestic and gang\nviolence would generally no longer be accepted as reasons for migrants to be\ngranted asylum. Trump has said this week that those in the caravan would not\nget asylum \u2014 though U.S. law allows them the right to apply \u2014 and warned them\nto turn around.\n\nThe Trump administration's vehement opposition and tough rhetoric has at least\nsome in the caravan weighing alternatives.\n\nTifany Morandis, 19, was traveling with her husband, 28-year-old Javier\nSanchez, and their two sons, 7-year-old Angel and 9-month-old Cesar. Her nose\nand face sun-scorched after many days on the road, she said she was very tired\nand is considering stopping in Tijuana, the Mexican border city across from\nSan Diego.\n\n\"Donald Trump has made things very complicated at the border, and better that\nwe stay in Tijuana than fight with him,\" Morandis said.\n\nBut many are hopeful. \"Even stones can soften,\" Cuellos said.\n\n",
