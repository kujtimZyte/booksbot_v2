                    "markdown": "# Why the Results in Wentworth Narrowed\n\n[Antony Green](/news/elections/antony-green/3496478), ABC Election Analyst\n\nUpdated  November 05, 2018 13:44:47\n\nDespite Kerryn Phelps appearing the clear winner of the Wentworth by-election\non election night, victory looked less certain twelve hours later after a\ndramatic narrowing of her lead.\n\nOn election night I called a victory for Kerryn Phelps at 7:18pm. Before 9pm\nPhelps herself claimed victory, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Liberal\ncandidate Dave Sharma conceded defeat.\n\nThe predicted swing at 7:18 was little changed by 10:30pm. The result for\nevery polling place had been reported and the predicted win for Phelps looked\nsecure. By all past postal and pre-poll vote trends in Wentworth, Phelps' lead\nwas unassailable.\n\nYet by lunchtime on Sunday Phelps' lead was only 884 votes and her two-\ncandidate preferred (2CP) result only 50.6%. Liberal Party hopes of victory\nrose.\n\nBy 6pm on Sunday Phelps was clearly back on track to win as the cause of the\nnarrowing became apparent.\n\nSo what happened? Had I called the result to early. Had the Liberal Party with\nits own data made the same mistake? Had we all forgotten about the \"Jewish\nvote\" in Wentworth?\n\nIn this post I'll explore what caused the post-election day narrowing.\n\nIn short, everyone underestimated how the Phelps campaign peaked on polling\nday and that it was less organised than the Liberal Party when postal voting\nbegan. The government's late campaign wobbles may have boosted Phelps' polling\nday performance.\n\nThere are also oddities with the postal and pre-poll votes, and the result is\na warning on how to deal with absent votes, a missing category of votes at by-\nelections.\n\n## The Progress of the Count\n\nThe graph below charts two measures of two-candidate preferred percentage for\nKerryn Phelps against the percentage vote counted.\n\nThe **blue line** is the actual 2CP% and includes counting on subsequent days.\n\nThe **black line** is a projected 2CP% for Phelps calculated from the\nprogressive count on election night. The projection has been calculated by the\nmatched swing method used by most election analysts and parties to accurately\npredict results.\n\nThe **gold line** is the final result, Phelps winning with 51.2% after\npreferences.\n\nDashed vertical lines in the graph highlight three important turning points in\nthe 15 hours after the last polling place reported.\n\nThe first line marks when the result for the large and strongly Liberal voting\nRose Bay pre-poll voting centre was entered. The second marks the entry of the\nfirst batch of strongly Liberal postal votes. The third dashed line marks when\nelection preference count errors from the night before were corrected during\nthe check count on Sunday.\n\nThe check count correction doubled Phelps' lead and removed the doubt over her\nvictory that had emerged on Sunday morning.\n\n[**External Link:** Wentworth By-election Progress of the Count\n](https://www.abc.net.au/news/interactives/fchart/?xml=//www.abc.net.au/dat/news/elections/byelections/2018\n-fed-wentworth/Wentworth_LIB2CP_ByPctCntd.xml&type=scatter&aspect=4x3)\n\nThe matched swing prediction method works by first calculating a swing\ncomparing percentage votes by party at the current election with the\npercentage vote by party at the previous election **in the same polling\nplaces**. This matched swing is then applied to the overall result of the last\nelection to produce a relatively stable predicted result.\n\nThe reason for using swing rather than 2CP% is that the swing is less variable\nby polling place than the 2CP%. In Wentworth the polling place Liberal 2CP%\nrose from a low of 27.2% to a high 68.6%, a range of 41% and a standard\ndeviation of 11.3. The swing was between -15.0 and -30.9 per polling place, a\nmuch smaller range of 15.9% and standard deviation of 3.9.\n\nAs the swing has a much smaller standard deviation, the progressive swing\nfigure used to make the prediction stabilises more quickly than the 2CP%. That\nis shown clearly in the above graph, the blue line of 2CP% bouncing around\nmuch more than the black prediction line based on swing.\n\nWith all polling places counted, representing 50.5% of enrolled votes from a\nlikely final turnout of under 80%, Phelp's 2CP% was 54.4%. Using the matched\nswing that takes account of the trend in postal, pre-poll and absent votes at\nthe last election, Phelps' predicted 2CP% was 53.3%.\n\nWith 54.4% of the two candidate preferred vote with all polling places\nreporting and half the vote counted, and with an expected turnout of 80%, the\nLiberal Party needed to poll 57.7% on pre-polls and postals to overcome\nPhelps' lead.\n\nThe predicted Phelps figure of 53.3% assumed Phelps would poll 51.1% of the\nvotes to come. In fact she polled only 45.5%, which is why her victory margin\nwas a narrower 51.2%.\n\nWhen you call an election result, you are saying that the candidate has a\nlarge enough two-candidate preferred lead to be certain they cannot lose from\nthat point. The call of victory for Phelps on election night proved correct as\nher lead was large enough to withstand even the unexpectedly large narrowing\nthat occurred.\n\nEvery electorate has a particular trend in postal, pre-poll and absent votes\nthat you factor in when making a prediction. It is true that the high \"Jewish\"\nvote in Wentworth gives a particular trend to postal and pre-poll trends. That\nparticular trend in Wentworth was factored into the by-election night\nprediction.\n\nAs I will describe below, the post-election night counting trend at the\nWentworth by-election was very different to the trend seen in Wentworth at\nelections over the past two decades. Compared to all previous elections in\nWentworth, the surge in support for the Liberal Party in pre-poll and postal\nvoting was much greater than seen before.\n\n## Previous Wentworth Results by Vote Type\n\nThe graph below plots the percentage point difference in Liberal 2CP% for\nAbsent, Postal and Pre-poll votes compared to votes cast on polling day in\nWentworth at elections since 1996. The dashed line shows the difference\nbetween polling day votes and the overall result for Wentworth.\n\n[**External Link:** Wentworth Results by Vote Type\n](https://www.abc.net.au/news/interactives/fchart/?xml=//www.abc.net.au/dat/news/elections/byelections/2018\n-fed-wentworth/Wentworth_LIB2CP_byType.xml&type=msline&aspect=4x3)\n\nThe graph shows clearly that Liberal support is much higher for Postal votes\nthan for votes cast on polling day. Liberal 2CP% support has consistently been\n10-13 percentage points higher than polling day votes. At the by-election the\nfinal postal vote difference was 14.8%, though the figure was 19% compared to\nthe first batches of postal votes reported.\n\nPre-Poll votes have also been stronger for the Liberal Party, usually 2-5\npercentage points higher, but at the Wentworth by-election double this figure\nat 10 percentage points higher.\n\nThe Absent vote trend has been very different, the Liberal 2CP% consistently\n6-8 percentage points lower than on polling day. There were no Absent votes at\nthe by-election.\n\nAn Absent vote is one cast outside of a voter's home division on election day.\nAbsent votes measure the propensity for voters to be outside of their\nelectorate on polling day. Absent voters are more likely to live nearer the\nedge of the electorate.\n\nIn the case of Wentworth, geography means that a voter who lives in Elizabeth\nBay, Clovelly or Randwick, is more likely to vote Absent in a neighbouring\nelectorate than a voter from Liberal heartland in of Vaucluse and Rose Bay.\nFor that reason, Absent voting in Wentworth tends to be less favourable for\nthe Liberal Party than polling day votes.\n\nThe inclusion of Absent Votes usually knocks around 0.5 percentage points off\nthe Liberal Party 2CP% in Wentworth. Had Absent votes been excluded from the\nlast election totals at the Wentworth by-election, the predicted result for\nPhelps on election night would have been reduced from 53.3% to 52.8%.\nSomething similar happened at the 2012 by-election in the Victorian state seat\nof Melbourne, when including Absent votes from the previous election resulted\nin an over-prediction of the Green vote. It may be best to exclude Absent\nvotes from an electorate's history when analysing by-elections.\n\nFocussing on the dashed line comparing polling day results with final results,\nbetween 1996 and 2016, the largest post-election night shift in Liberal 2CP%\nseen previously was 1.5% in 2013 and 1.2% in 2016.\n\nAt the by-election the gap more than doubled to 4%. The narrowing from Phelps'\nby-election night margin wasn't because I hadn't factored in the Postal and\nPre-poll votes. It was because I hadn't predicted that the difference between\nvotes cast on polling day and votes cast would be so much greater than seen\npreviously in Wentworth.\n\nThat the gap was larger is a reflection of the swing being larger on polling\nday compared to votes cast before polling day.\n\nThe two-candidate preferred swing against the Liberal Party was 21.8% on\npolling day, 15.2% in Pre-poll votes, and 17.0% with Postal votes. If the\nswing on polling day had been the same as that recorded amongst votes cast\nbefore polling day, the Liberal Party would have won the Wentworth by-\nelection.\n\n## Explaining the Postal and Pre-Poll Difference\n\nMore than 12,800 postal vote applications were received, processed and ballot\npapers dispatched. 9,003 postal votes were returned and admitted to the count.\nOnce you include postal votes returned but rejected from the count for a\nvariety of reasons, the return rate is around 75%, normal for a by-election.\n\nOf the postal vote applications received, 3,713 were via the AEC's on-line\npostal vote application. 5,913 were received via paper application forms,\nalmost all of which were prompted by a Liberal Party mail-out.\n\nAnother 3,234 were for registered general postal voters. Voters who are old,\nill or otherwise infirm, are registered as silent voters, or who have\nreligious objections to voting on a Saturday, can choose to be registered as\ngeneral postal voters. General postal voters are sent postal vote packs as\nsoon as nominations are closed without the need for an application. ([You can\nfind out who is entitled to be a general postal voter at the AEC\nwebsite.](https://www.aec.gov.au/Enrolling_to_vote/Special_Category/General_postal_voters.htm))\n\nVoters can apply for a postal vote as soon as the date of the election is\nknown. Postal votes packs are dispatched on the Monday after the close of\nnominations, and Pre-poll voting starts on the Tuesday after the close of\nnominations. Applications for Postal votes close the Wednesday before polling\nday.\n\nThe graph below plots the total Postal vote applications by day and the total\nPre-poll votes cast.\n\n[**External Link:** Wentworth Postal and Pre-Poll Votes\n](https://www.abc.net.au/news/interactives/fchart/?xml=//www.abc.net.au/dat/news/elections/byelections/2018\n-fed-wentworth/Wentworth_Postal_Prepoll.xml&type=scatter&aspect=4x3)\n\nThe huge increase in postal vote applications a few days before the close of\nnominations corresponds to general postal voters being added to the mail-out\nlist. The graph shows that by the close of nominations, around 7,000 postal\nvote packs were ready for mail-out. These votes were overwhelmingly general\npostal voters and early responders to the Liberal Party's postal vote\napplication.\n\nOf Pre-poll voters, roughly 8,000 were cast in the two weeks after the close\nof nominations, and 10,000 were cast in the last week of the campaign, the\nnumbers peaking on the Thursday and Friday before polling day.\n\nPresumably the early postal votes were a large proportion of the roughly 5,000\npostal votes received, processed and counted on election night for inclusion\non the Sunday morning. These votes were overwhelmingly in favour of the\nLiberal Party.\n\nThe graph below plots the Liberal 2CP% in the Postal vote count with each\nday's counting. As the plot shows, the Liberal 2CP% slipped every day.\n\nOn first preferences, the first batch of postal votes split Liberal; 57.3%,\nPhelps 17.2%, Labor 12.4% and Greens 4.8%. By the last batch, the first\npreferences were Liberal 35.4%, Phelps 31.8%, Labor 14.4% and the Greens\n11.9%.\n\n[**External Link:** Wentworth Trend in Postal Votes\n](https://www.abc.net.au/news/interactives/fchart/?xml=//www.abc.net.au/dat/news/elections/byelections/2018\n-fed-wentworth/Wentworth_Postals.xml&type=msline&aspect=4x3)\n\nAssuming the postal vote receipts by the AEC reflect when votes were completed\nand returned, there are two possible explanations for the postal vote trend.\n\nThe first is logistical, that the Phelps campaign was disorganised at the\nstart of the campaign and did not have a well organised postal vote strategy.\nThe Liberal advantage in the general postal votes and early applications was\nreflected in the early returned postal votes being stronger for the Liberal\nParty.\n\nA second may reflect the campaign itself, with the Phelps campaign peaking on\nelection day. The Liberal Party spent the last 10 days of the campaign either\ntrying to stamp out political bushfires, or trying to contain their own\npolitical backburns that had got out of control.\n\nBut that doesn't explain why the Pre-polls were so solid for the Liberal\nParty. If it was the last 10 days of the campaign that lost Wentworth for the\ngovernment, why wasn't this reflected in the Pre-poll votes given how many\nwere cast in the last days?\n\nThe answer may be in the positioning of the Pre-poll Voting Centres.\n\nAt the 2016 Federal election there were four Pre-Poll Voting centres,\nHaymarket (720 votes, Liberal 2CP 58.9%), Waverley (10,509, 73.2%), Randwick\n(1,820, 62.1%) and Sydney Town Hall (2,174, 66.1%). There were also 3,830 pre-\npolls taken outside of the electorate with Liberal 2CP of 62.9%. Only the\nWaverley Pre-Poll Voting Centres was within the boundaries of Wentworth.\n\nAt the by-election, two new centres within the electorate were used. The four\npre-poll centres were Haymarket (1,142 votes, Liberal 2CP 39.4%), Paddington\n(3,424, 43.1%), Rose Bay (6,781, 69.7%) and Waverley (7,106, 49.5%). There\nwere only 306 external pre-polls recording a Liberal 2CP of 37.2%.\n\nIt may be that the smaller swing on pre-polls reflects a change in where pre-\npoll voting centres were located. In 2016 7,800 pre-poll votes were recorded\nat pre-poll centres outside of the electorate where the Liberal vote was lower\nthan within the electorate. At the by-election, 6,781 pre-polls taken in the\nLiberal heart of the electorate at Rose Bay where the Liberal Party vote was\nstronger than recorded in any polling place on election day. There was a drop\nin votes cast at nearby polling places on the day.\n\nThe Rose Bay Pre-Poll centre was on New South Head Road in the Rose Bay\nshopping centre, the main transport route through to the strongest Liberal\nvoting parts of the electorate. The Rose Bay Pre-Poll centre may have re-\narranged when and where people voted in Liberal parts of the electorates,\nwhich explains why the Pre-Poll trend was so different.\n\nA final note to make about Postal and Pre-Poll votes is the rise in their use.\nIn 1996 82.7% of all votes were cast in polling places in Wentworth on polling\nday. Postal Votes comprised 3.9% of votes and Pre-Poll Votes 6.0%.\n\nAt the 2016 election polling day votes were 61.6% of all votes, Postal Votes\n11.2% and Pre-Poll Votess 23.4%. The numbers for the by-election were not\nsignificantly different, 65.3% on the day votes, Postals 10.8% and Pre-Polls\n23.4%\n\nWhile the numbers of Postal and Pre-poll votes has increased over the last two\ndecades, the change between the 2016 election and the by-election was not\nsignificant enough to have an impact on election night predictions.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThere are several trends that resulted in the overnight narrowing of the\nelection result.\n\n  * 0.7% of the narrowing next morning was caused by the preference count errors that were corrected in the afternoon.\n  * 0.5% of narrowing came about through factoring in Absent Votes that didn't exist at the by-election.\n  * The first batch of postal votes was much worse for Phelps than the final postal vote totals.\n  * The Liberal Party gained another 0.2% on its lead through winning the Special Hospital vote 266-54.\n  * Phelps did much better on polling day than among votes cast before polling day, though it is not possible to be certain if the difference is due to campaign issues of the last week or organisational issues for Phelps earlier in the campaign.\n  * The much smaller swing in Pre-Poll votes may be due to changes in the location of Pre-Poll Voting Centres.\n\nThere may also be an issue with the composition of the final two candidates.\nIf the by-election had been a contest between Labor and Liberal, I suspect the\nswing would have been more uniform. With Kerryn Phelps being the Liberal\nParty's opponent, there were cross cutting issues that allowed Liberal voters\nto switch to Phelps that were different for Labor or Green voters switching to\nPhelps.\n\nThere was always the chance that the swing across the electorate would vary\nmore than normal. That didn't happen as the polling day swing was very\nuniform. Instead, the difference in swing between polling day votes and votes\ncast before polling day was much greater than expected and much larger than\npreviously recorded in Wentworth.\n\nFirst posted  November 05, 2018 12:30:38\n\n",

It was because I hadn't predicted that the difference between\nvotes cast on polling day and votes cast would be so much greater than seen\npreviously in Wentworth.\nThat the gap was larger is a reflection of the swing being larger on polling\nday compared to votes cast before polling day.\nThe two-candidate preferred swing against the Liberal Party was 21.8% on\npolling day, 15.2% in Pre-poll votes, and 17.0% with Postal votes. If the\nswing on polling day had been the same as that recorded amongst votes cast\nbefore polling day, the Liberal Party would have won the Wentworth by-\nelection.\nExplaining the Postal and Pre-Poll Difference\nMore than 12,800 postal vote applications were received, processed and ballot\npapers dispatched. 9,003 postal votes were returned and admitted to the count.\nOnce you include postal votes returned but rejected from the count for a\nvariety of reasons, the return rate is around 75%, normal for a by-election.\nOf the postal vote applications received, 3,713 were via the AEC's on-line\npostal vote application. 5,913 were received via paper application forms,\nalmost all of which were prompted by a Liberal Party mail-out.\nAnother 3,234 were for registered general postal voters. Voters who are old,\nill or otherwise infirm, are registered as silent voters, or who have\nreligious objections to voting on a Saturday, can choose to be registered as\ngeneral postal voters. General postal voters are sent postal vote packs as\nsoon as nominations are closed without the need for an application. (You can\nfind out who is entitled to be a general postal voter at the AEC\nwebsite.)\nVoters can apply for a postal vote as soon as the date of the election is\nknown. Postal votes packs are dispatched on the Monday after the close of\nnominations, and Pre-poll voting starts on the Tuesday after the close of\nnominations. Applications for Postal votes close the Wednesday before polling\nday.\nThe graph below plots the total Postal vote applications by day and the total\nPre-poll votes cast.\nExternal Link: Wentworth Postal and Pre-Poll Votes\n\nThe huge increase in postal vote applications a few days before the close of\nnominations corresponds to general postal voters being added to the mail-out\nlist. The graph shows that by the close of nominations, around 7,000 postal\nvote packs were ready for mail-out. These votes were overwhelmingly general\npostal voters and early responders to the Liberal Party's postal vote\napplication.\nOf Pre-poll voters, roughly 8,000 were cast in the two weeks after the close\nof nominations, and 10,000 were cast in the last week of the campaign, the\nnumbers peaking on the Thursday and Friday before polling day.\nPresumably the early postal votes were a large proportion of the roughly 5,000\npostal votes received, processed and counted on election night for inclusion\non the Sunday morning. These votes were overwhelmingly in favour of the\nLiberal Party.\nThe graph below plots the Liberal 2CP% in the Postal vote count with each\nday's counting. As the plot shows, the Liberal 2CP% slipped every day.\nOn first preferences, the first batch of postal votes split Liberal; 57.3%,\nPhelps 17.2%, Labor 12.4% and Greens 4.8%. By the last batch, the first\npreferences were Liberal 35.4%, Phelps 31.8%, Labor 14.4% and the Greens\n11.9%.\nExternal Link: Wentworth Trend in Postal Votes\n\nAssuming the postal vote receipts by the AEC reflect when votes were completed\nand returned, there are two possible explanations for the postal vote trend.\nThe first is logistical, that the Phelps campaign was disorganised at the\nstart of the campaign and did not have a well organised postal vote strategy.\nThe Liberal advantage in the general postal votes and early applications was\nreflected in the early returned postal votes being stronger for the Liberal\nParty.\nA second may reflect the campaign itself, with the Phelps campaign peaking on\nelection day. The Liberal Party spent the last 10 days of the campaign either\ntrying to stamp out political bushfires, or trying to contain their own\npolitical backburns that had got out of control.\nBut that doesn't explain why the Pre-polls were so solid for the Liberal\nParty. If it was the last 10 days of the campaign that lost Wentworth for the\ngovernment, why wasn't this reflected in the Pre-poll votes given how many\nwere cast in the last days?\nThe answer may be in the positioning of the Pre-poll Voting Centres.\nAt the 2016 Federal election there were four Pre-Poll Voting centres,\nHaymarket (720 votes, Liberal 2CP 58.9%), Waverley (10,509, 73.2%), Randwick\n(1,820, 62.1%) and Sydney Town Hall (2,174, 66.1%). There were also 3,830 pre-\npolls taken outside of the electorate with Liberal 2CP of 62.9%. Only the\nWaverley Pre-Poll Voting Centres was within the boundaries of Wentworth.\nAt the by-election, two new centres within the electorate were used. The four\npre-poll centres were Haymarket (1,142 votes, Liberal 2CP 39.4%), Paddington\n(3,424, 43.1%), Rose Bay (6,781, 69.7%) and Waverley (7,106, 49.5%). There\nwere only 306 external pre-polls recording a Liberal 2CP of 37.2%.\nIt may be that the smaller swing on pre-polls reflects a change in where pre-\npoll voting centres were located. In 2016 7,800 pre-poll votes were recorded\nat pre-poll centres outside of the electorate where the Liberal vote was lower\nthan within the electorate. At the by-election, 6,781 pre-polls taken in the\nLiberal heart of the electorate at Rose Bay where the Liberal Party vote was\nstronger than recorded in any polling place on election day. There was a drop\nin votes cast at nearby polling places on the day.\nThe Rose Bay Pre-Poll centre was on New South Head Road in the Rose Bay\nshopping centre, the main transport route through to the strongest Liberal\nvoting parts of the electorate. The Rose Bay Pre-Poll centre may have re-\narranged when and where people voted in Liberal parts of the electorates,\nwhich explains why the Pre-Poll trend was so different.\nA final note to make about Postal and Pre-Poll votes is the rise in their use.\nIn 1996 82.7% of all votes were cast in polling places in Wentworth on polling\nday. Postal Votes comprised 3.9% of votes and Pre-Poll Votes 6.0%.\nAt the 2016 election polling day votes were 61.6% of all votes, Postal Votes\n11.2% and Pre-Poll Votess 23.4%. The numbers for the by-election were not\nsignificantly different, 65.3% on the day votes, Postals 10.8% and Pre-Polls\n23.4%\nWhile the numbers of Postal and Pre-poll votes has increased over the last two\ndecades, the change between the 2016 election and the by-election was not\nsignificant enough to have an impact on election night predictions.\nConclusions\nThere are several trends that resulted in the overnight narrowing of the\nelection result.\n\n0.7% of the narrowing next morning was caused by the preference count errors that were corrected in the afternoon.\n0.5% of narrowing came about through factoring in Absent Votes that didn't exist at the by-election.\nThe first batch of postal votes was much worse for Phelps than the final postal vote totals.\nThe Liberal Party gained another 0.2% on its lead through winning the Special Hospital vote 266-54.\nPhelps did much better on polling day than among votes cast before polling day, though it is not possible to be certain if the difference is due to campaign issues of the last week or organisational issues for Phelps earlier in the campaign.\nThe much smaller swing in Pre-Poll votes may be due to changes in the location of Pre-Poll Voting Centres.\n\nThere may also be an issue with the composition of the final two candidates.\nIf the by-election had been a contest between Labor and Liberal, I suspect the\nswing would have been more uniform. With Kerryn Phelps being the Liberal\nParty's opponent, there were cross cutting issues that allowed Liberal voters\nto switch to Phelps that were different for Labor or Green voters switching to\nPhelps.\nThere was always the chance that the swing across the electorate would vary\nmore than normal. That didn't happen as the polling day swing was very\nuniform. Instead, the difference in swing between polling day votes and votes\ncast before polling day was much greater than expected and much larger than\npreviously recorded in Wentworth.\nFirst posted  November 05, 2018 12:30:38"
