The film __ provides a pretty intimate, charming portrayal of the legendary animator from the announcement of his retirement (September 2013) through much of the production on _Boro the_ _Caterpillar,_ Miyazaki's first film done entirely with CGI (that short film [debuted last year](https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/miyazaki\u2019s-new-animated-short-%27boro-the-caterpillar%27-completed-voice-actor-revealed)).\n\n[](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/between-cintiq-and-streaming-animation-is-thriving-ask-titmouses-chris-prynoski/)\n\n### Further Reading\n\n[Between Cintiq and streaming, animation is thriving\u2014ask Titmouse\u2019s Chris Prynoski](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/between-cintiq-and-streaming-animation-is-thriving-ask-titmouses-chris-prynoski/)\n\nThroughout a short hour-ish runtime, this documentary maintains a very narrow focus. _Never-Ending Man_ really only consists of footage of Miyazaki at home or at the studio, and it relies solely on interviews directly with the man or with collaborators on this project. The approach allows viewers to draw their own conclusions about why this work remains great and what makes Miyazaki tick rather than having any longtime observers or contemporaries spell such things out.\n\n## Miyazaki and CGI\n\nIf you're a hardcore Studio Ghibli fan, you're likely saying, \"Wait, he's definitely used CGI before.\" [That's correct](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/hayao-miyazaki-latest-film-cgi-caterpillar)\u2014 _Boro_ was simply the first time Miyazaki relied on it entirely for the final product. In his film's linear notes, Director Kaku Arakawa explains: \"Mr. Miyazaki was very skeptical about CG animation from the get-go. He first implemented the technology in the movie _Princess Mononoke_ , then later successfully blended it seamlessly with hand-drawn animation in _Spirited Away_. But he parted ways with CG after _Howl\u2019s Moving Castle_. In the following films _Ponyo_ and _The Wind Rises_ , he went back to traditional hand-drawn animation. He has always made animation with this challenge foremost in his mind; how much can the human hand draw?\n\n\"Since he\u2019s strongly convinced that '[anime] has to be hand drawn,' I don\u2019t think he was expecting much from the technology when he met these young CG animators. What drew him to the opportunity was that he saw something in their eyes; their strong ambition and desire to accomplish something meaningful in their budding field. He told me, 'They remind me of my old self.'\u201d\n\nEven at this age (in his 70s), Miyazaki has an incredible dedication to detail, for instance. To make a less-than-15-minute short about a caterpillar, he's putting insects under a microscope and working through several hand-drawn interactions before anything shows up on a computer screen. In early film footage showing pre-CGI **** life at Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki stands over young illustrators' shoulders and offers nuanced feedback: \"It\u2019s important to draw full human beings; you\u2019re drawing people not characters,\u201d he tells them, soon offering slight critiques on a character's running form or how they hold a bundled-up blanket. Later, when working with CGI, Miyazaki may not understand or have comfort with the tools and medium, but he continues to share similarly micro observations. \"The turning motion is too adult like,\" he says, watching an early render of Boro looking around his landscape. \"Babies don\u2019t turn their heads so sharply.\"\n\nMiyazaki seems to know he's a throwback and never shies away from this\u2014he smokes cigarettes still and insists initially on having the background landscape for _Boro_ drawn by hand\u2014but what makes him an all-time great is perhaps the man's desire to make contemporary work, things that take advantage of all these new techniques and abilities, in spite of those urges. \u201cYou think CGI offers new possibilities? That\u2019s not it,\" he says when asked why bother when fans would inevitably turn out for more of his previous stuff. \"I have ideas I may not be able to draw by hand, and this may be a way to do it\u2014that\u2019s my hope. It\u2019s a new technology.\u201d\n\nThis challenge clearly energized the creator. Colleagues joke Miyazaki seems to be siphoning energy from the young people around him, given the age difference with all the CGI animators. _Never-Ending Man_ Director Kaku Arakawa even observed physical changes in the animator: according to the film's linear notes, Miyazaki started drawing Boro with very soft pencils (6B) \"to compensate for his weakened grip.\" Over time, \"as he got fired up making the CG animation and got absorbed in creating the short, he was drawing with 2B pencils again without realizing it... Mr. Miyazaki was embarrassed to admit it and exclaimed, 'It\u2019s not that easy to regain strength!\"\u201d\n\n  * The animation legend, Hayao Miyazaki. (Spoiler: He does it.) \n\nKaku Arakawa / GKIDS \n\n  * Want to draw a caterpillar? Probably should observe one, first. \u201cI can\u2019t draw a caterpillar with a pencil,\" Miyazaki says. \"So i\u2019ll turn to CGI.\u201d \n\nKaku Arakawa / GKIDS \n\n  * Young Hayao Miyazaki from the new documentary, _Never-Ending Man_. \n\nKaku Arakawa / GKIDS \n\n  * Early proof of concepts for Boro, the subject of Miyazaki's first CGI-animated short. \n\nKaku Arakawa / GKIDS \n\n  * A still from the final product. \n\n[Studio Ghibli](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/)\n\n  * Miyazaki won't be abandoning his pencil and paper any time soon, but he willingly tinkers with Wacom tablets and similar tech. \n\nKaku Arakawa / GKIDS \n\n\n\n\nThis film clearly has long-time fans in mind. _Never-Ending Man_ doesn't spend much time at all catching viewers up on who Hayao Miyazaki is, how he's built his career, or what impact his films made. Such history seems contained to a few short film clips and a sequence with Miyazaki flipping through old scrapbooks while acknowledging how fortunate he was in retrospect that his deeply personal ideas and tastes found larger popularity (\"If we tried to please, we\u2019d be forgotten,\u201d he says). For someone who has only seen a few of the big works ( _My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle_ ), the film leaves you wanting a bit more historical and outside perspective. It's easy to imagine a documentary that does better to contextualize the obvious legacy here in a way that something like last year's _[Gilbert](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/evs-jeffrey-dahmer-and-gilbert-gottfried-get-big-screen-origin-stories/), _ on raunchy comedian Gilbert Gottfried, did for watchers who know the name but not the whole story.\n\n[](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/disaster-magic-realism-and-post-apocalyptic-action-get-animated-at-fantastic-fest/)\n\n### Further Reading\n\n[Disaster, magic realism, and post-apocalyptic action get animated at Fantastic Fest](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/disaster-magic-realism-and-post-apocalyptic-action-get-animated-at-fantastic-fest/)\n\nThat said, this film still works as a small portrait of an all-time great still seeking a new challenge, a study of someone anxious to know whether the abilities and ideas that garnered such acclaim can work in what's admittedly a new playing field. _Never-Ending Man_ never comes out and says this, but the documentary continuously hints that technology has changed animation forever and may one day render the very thing that made Miyazaki\u2014his [unparalleled ability](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/video-inside-the-artistic-mind-of-dead-space-designer-glen-schofield/) to translate the ideas in his head to paper through impeccable artistic skill\u2014useless. Late in the film, for example, someone's pitching Miyazaki on AI-enabled animation that will be able to emulate human painting within the next decade.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop CGI from taking over animated films,\u201d Miyazaki says early in _Never-Ending Man._ He's sketching out the lush world for _Boro,_ __ coming to terms with this new reality for his beloved medium. \"I did such a detailed layout not because I don\u2019t trust them, but I want them to create something even better.\"\n\nMaybe CGI ultimately will win out\u2014 _Boro_ debuted to much fanfare, and certainly studios like [Pixar](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/incredibles-2-review-brad-bird-pixar-are-on-fire-with-this-superhero-sequel/) have become the premier names in animation today. But analog illustration offers something different even if the process itself isn't as efficient, and it's hard to imagine admiration for that ever totally evaporating. After all, while you may be able to find _Never-Ending Man_ playing nearby, you're perhaps even more likely to find _[Totoro](https://tickets.fandango.com/transaction/ticketing/express/ticketboxoffice.aspx?row_count=260266417&tid=AAWKE&a=11584&from=Redirect.aspx&mid=56197&wssaffid=11584_GoogleOneBox\\(DeskandMobile\\)&wssac=90&refreshdate=02%2f25%2f2019) _ or _[Howl's Moving Castle](https://tickets.fandango.com/transaction/ticketing/express/ticketboxoffice.aspx?row_count=260266416&tid=AAWKE&a=11584&from=Redirect.aspx&mid=90877&wssaffid=11584_GoogleOneBox\\(DeskandMobile\\)&wssac=90&refreshdate=02%2f18%2f2019), _ too.\n\n_Director Kaku Arakawa's_ Never-Ending Man _was made in 2016, but it didn't receive a US theatrical release until December of last year.[Screenings](http://gkidstickets.com/us/neverendingman/?campaign=gkidssite) can still be found in select cities. _\n\n_Listing image by Kaku Arakawa / GKIDS_\n\n[](/author/nathan-mattise)\n",
