The league, which has been\naround since 2003, aims to reclaim the raw power of women's mud wrestling,\nwithout the over-sexualized image. What started as a goofy fight among friends\nevolved into a legit organization that hosts indoor matches from April through\nOctober at music venues and bars throughout the city. Since 2004, the team has\ndonated profits from their events to charity.\n\nThe provocative, witty, and aggressively [skilled women who sling\nmud](https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/qvmxjp/great-american-mud-wrestle-\nwalter-pearce-lily-rose-depp-lotta-volkova) (and occasionally slime, lube, or\nspaghetti) at each other have earned the Mud Queens a cult following in\nChicago. The biggest match of the year takes place every Halloween at Reggie\u2019s\nRock Club in Chicago's South Loop. The mud is swapped out for fake blood\n(though the recipe for the slick stuff stays secret). It's a combination of\npunk rock, feminism, contact sports, and activism that embodies the Windy\nCity's gritty, DIY ethos.\n\nVICE checked out this year's Halloween event with photographer [Danielle\nScruggs](https://www.instagram.com/dascruggs_/?hl=en) to meet the Mud Queens\nand get a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to throw a bloody good\nwrestling match.\n\n## Kira Elliot, a.k.a.

There are a lot of reasons I\ndo it. My favorite part is the women involved in the organization. They\u2019re\nhilarious, and there is an amazing sisterhood in the group. Everybody just\nreally enjoys each other. We all live these buttoned-up lives, and it\u2019s cool\nto let loose and do something that\u2019s off-the-charts wild and crazy. Every\nyear, after our final show, we give a lump sum of our earnings to the Chicago\nWomen\u2019s Health Center. I think it\u2019s really important to take care of people,\nespecially women with reproductive needs. Chicago is competing against New\nYork and Los Angeles, and there is something gritty about Mud Queens being\nhere.

You're on tomorrow at 7 PM.' She put me up against one of the largest\nfighters, and I lost very hard. I lost every fight for the next four years\nstraight, and it wasn\u2019t until my fifth year that I won my first fight. It\u2019s a\nreally good feeling when you look out into the audience and people are\ncheering. It\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ve grown addicted to.
