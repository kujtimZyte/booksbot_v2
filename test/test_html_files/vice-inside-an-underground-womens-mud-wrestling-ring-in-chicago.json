The league, which has been around since 2003, aims to reclaim the raw power of women's mud wrestling, without the over-sexualized image. What started as a goofy fight among friends evolved into a legit organization that hosts indoor matches from April through October at music venues and bars throughout the city. Since 2004, the team has donated profits from their events to charity.\n\nThe provocative, witty, and aggressively [skilled women who sling mud](https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/qvmxjp/great-american-mud-wrestle-walter-pearce-lily-rose-depp-lotta-volkova) (and occasionally slime, lube, or spaghetti) at each other have earned the Mud Queens a cult following in Chicago. The biggest match of the year takes place every Halloween at Reggie\u2019s Rock Club in Chicago's South Loop. The mud is swapped out for fake blood (though the recipe for the slick stuff stays secret). It's a combination of punk rock, feminism, contact sports, and activism that embodies the Windy City's gritty, DIY ethos.\n\nVICE checked out this year's Halloween event with photographer [Danielle Scruggs](https://www.instagram.com/dascruggs_/?hl=en) to meet the Mud Queens and get a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to throw a bloody good wrestling match.\n\n## Kira Elliot, a.k.a.

There are a lot of reasons I do it. My favorite part is the women involved in the organization. They\u2019re hilarious, and there is an amazing sisterhood in the group. Everybody just really enjoys each other. We all live these buttoned-up lives, and it\u2019s cool to let loose and do something that\u2019s off-the-charts wild and crazy. Every year, after our final show, we give a lump sum of our earnings to the Chicago Women\u2019s Health Center. I think it\u2019s really important to take care of people, especially women with reproductive needs. Chicago is competing against New York and Los Angeles, and there is something gritty about Mud Queens being here. It gives Chicago a bit more of an edge and reputation of being badass and hardcore.\"\n\n## Erica de Marco, a.k.a.

I came across a flyer for a Mud Queens show and texted the founder and said, 'I want to do this. How do I get trained?' She texted back and said, 'We had a girl drop out. You're on tomorrow at 7 PM.' She put me up against one of the largest fighters, and I lost very hard. I lost every fight for the next four years straight, and it wasn\u2019t until my fifth year that I won my first fight. It\u2019s a really good feeling when you look out into the audience and people are cheering. It\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ve grown addicted to. We\u2019re breaking stereotypes. When you think of mud wrestling, you think of girls rolling around seductively, but we bring strength to it.\"\n\n##  Mark Macoun, a.k.a. the Ref\n\n![1541445026255-Scruggs_MudQueens-11](https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1541445026255-Scruggs_MudQueens-11.jpeg?resize=320:*)\n\nMark Macoun, aka the referee, is a public servant and one of the original members of Mud Queens. \u00a9 Danielle Scruggs\n\n\u201cMy buddy Megan wanted to do jello wrestling, but we didn\u2019t know where to store that much jello, so we made mud.

We're underground, but we've been around for 15 years. It has to be one of the city's longest running shows at this point.

It\u2019s badass women who are taking back mud wrestling. It's a piece of Chicago culture other cities really don't have. It's a grassroots effort that's badass, crude, and brash\u2014like the city itself. Our first show was at a birthday party in someone's apartment, put together as a joke, but everyone had a great time. All of our friends' bands played, and we started doing more shows from there. The first four or five were stopped by police. There were a couple times they were called for noise complaints, and the cops would stay and watch [ _laughs_ ].\n\n\"I didn\u2019t think we'd ever be allowed in a legit venue. When we were on loading docks, we had to move dumpsters and someone was scratched by a rat. It was pretty ramshackle. We never thought we would ever do a \u2018real\u2019 show. We started charging at the door to make up the money for supplies, and we ended up with more money than we knew what to do with, so we thought the best thing to do was give it to charity.

The costumes have gotten more intricate, and the organization itself is more organized. We\u2019ve adapted.
